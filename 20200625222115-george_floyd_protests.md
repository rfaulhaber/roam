# George Floyd protests

The George Floyd protests (as of <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2020-06-25 Thu]</span></span>) are a wave of uprisings across the United States in response to the murder of George Floyd, an African-American man who was murdered by Minneapolis police on May 25th, 2020. Shortly after his death there were a wave of riots, and in Minneapolis the 3rd precinct police station was captured and burned down by protesters.

What&rsquo;s unusual about these protests is that they have an unusually high degree of sympathy, whereas previous [[Black Lives Matter]] protests did not have that.
