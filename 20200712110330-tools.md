## Notes

In order to properly implement the Zettelkasten method, you don&rsquo;t need much. It&rsquo;s about an improvement to workflow rather than about using The One Right Toolâ„¢.

Zettelkasten is about maximizing the focus of your work: _thinking_.

### Tools needed

1.  Something to write with and something to write on (I need to get a notebook myself)
    -   It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a physical notebook, it just has to be somewhere where you can jot down ideas quickly and temporarily. These notes are meant to be processed at least once daily.
2.  A reference management system
    -   Purpose of the reference system is to collect references of things you&rsquo;re reading.
3.  A slip-box
4.  An editor

In my case, my tools are:

1.  TBD
2.  org-ref
3.  org-roam / deft
4.  Emacs (obviously)
