Alienation refers to estrangement in some form or another.

## Hegel

Alienation comes from [[Hegel]], which, for him, was the recognition of the other. Hegel believed that freedom could come from alienation.

Alienation was also seen for Hegel as the separation of man from God, and that the only way humankind can come to know itself is through the separation from God. This idea seems to have been derived from [[hermetics]].
