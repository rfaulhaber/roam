Capitalism created a hungry mob through its mass emiseration of workers (see [[primitve accumulation]]), and thus social unrest was more common in capitalist societies where workers really didn&rsquo;t have anything to lose but their chains. Since the Second World War, however, capitalism in Western countries has been able to raise living standards such that an entire type of social unrest has become less common.
