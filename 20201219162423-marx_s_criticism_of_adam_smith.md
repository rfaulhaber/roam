## From Capital Vol. 2

Marx&rsquo;s criticisms of Smith in Chapter 10 of Volume 2 amount to Smith not understanding different forms of capital. Smith doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between fixed or fluid capital, and makes errors in determining what wages are to workers.

-   Marx criticizes Adam Smith for believing that wages are a form of capital
-   Marx criticizes Smith practically every other sentence for confusing constant and variable capital
