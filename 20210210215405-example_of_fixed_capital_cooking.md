As I understand it, if cooking a meal is analagous to the production process, fixed capital can be thought of as things like spices or seasoning: you don&rsquo;t use all of your salt to season just one dish, and then go and buy a whole thing of salt all over again. You use it incrementally, until finally it&rsquo;s gone.
