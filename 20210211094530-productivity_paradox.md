The idea of the productivity paradox comes from the observation that the promise of computerization never bore fruit. Computerization was supposed to make everyone more productive, and because everyone is more productive, this should make society generally wealthier (increasing wages, GDP, etc.). In reality, however, this hasn&rsquo;t happened. Although there was a modest boost in labor productivity in the 90s from computerizations of certain types of businesses by and large this hasn&rsquo;t happened.
