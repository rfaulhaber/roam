## Unions as the bodies that will bring about socialism

There are those (such as [[syndicalists]]) who believe that trade unions are at the forefront of revolutionary activity, and that because unions are closest to the labor process, unions are the ones who can bring about not just improvement for working conditions but revolutionary change as well.

Arguably, the [[soviets]] were one such example: organizations that worked with unions and persisted after the revolution, albeit neutered.

## Unions as organizations within capitalism

Likewise, there are those who say that unions will only exist in capitalism, and that at best all unions can do is improve working conditions. There may be some truth to this, but I believe that it&rsquo;s too dismissive of the role of unions.
