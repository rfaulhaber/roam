    Early socialists in particular likely advocated for republicanism over direct democracy or outright abolition of the state because they all lived under autocracies.

The [[SPD]] called for a republic in [[Germany]] because they lived under the [[Second Reich]], which itself was an empire. Russian revolutionaries also called for a republic given that they lived under an empire.
