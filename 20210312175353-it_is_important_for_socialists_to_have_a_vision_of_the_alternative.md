Socialists ought to have a positive vision of the future, rather than just a negative vision of the present. Having a clear idea about what the future should be, regardless of it is, at least gives us goals for the kind of world we should be building.

Increasingly, as we are told that [[there is no alternative]], but as socialists we ought to advocate for an alternative, knowing what we know.

Although [[Marx]] famously did not speak much on what communism would be like, he was trying not to be prescriptive like the [[utopian socialists]] before him.
