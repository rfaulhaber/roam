# Marx's analysis in Capital Vol. 1 is POSIWID

In [[Capital Vol. 1]], [[Marx]] primarily critiques [[capitalism]] and capitalist ideology. He critiques a whole host of apologists for capitalism as well as those who simply frame the argument. Marx&rsquo;s analysis is very much a &ldquo;[[the purpose of a system is what it does]]&rdquo; kind of argument: he looks at how capitalism behaves, using the terms of the bourgeois economists, and shows that the purpose of capitalism is indeed what it does by demonstrating [[general law of capitalist accumulation]], which explains why poverty exists and must exist under capitalism.
