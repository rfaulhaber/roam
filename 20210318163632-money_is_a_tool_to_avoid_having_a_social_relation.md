> Money is a thing that we use to avoid having a social relation. &#x2014; Colin Drumm, 3/17/21

I think this encapsulates what money does well. Within [[capitalism]] money allows for people to purchase things without having a direct social relation, i.e. I don&rsquo;t need to expect anyone to make my clothes for me directly. I have no clue who makes my clothes, and money enables this kind of social relation, rather than a direct one.

Without money, in [[communism]], we&rsquo;d need a way of having something similar, lest everyone is to make their own clothes (which maybe they do!).
