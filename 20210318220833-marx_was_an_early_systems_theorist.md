# Marx was an early systems theorist

: [[Marx]] [[Systems theory]]

Based on what I&rsquo;ve seen in [[Capital Vol. 1]] and [[Capital Vol. 2]], Marx thinks of [[capitalism]] as a system rather than some kind of static thing, and this is one advantage he has over the classical economists. [[Adam Smith]] et. al. seem to see capitalism as some static force, while Marx sees the system in motion.
