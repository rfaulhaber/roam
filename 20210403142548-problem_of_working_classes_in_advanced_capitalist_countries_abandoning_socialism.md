# problem of working classes in advanced capitalist countries abandoning socialism

Not a very succinct title.

In the history of capitalist development, there is an observed problem that the working classes abandon socialism or are otherwise divided. For them class struggle isn&rsquo;t the most important thing. This is thought to be at least partially caused by [[labor aristocracy]] and subsequently [[imperialism]].
