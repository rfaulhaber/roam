# Project Urbs

tags
: [[my projects]]

Project Urbs is the codename for a personal project I&rsquo;d like to work on. This is the space to work out the details of Urbs.

_Urbs_ is Latin for &ldquo;city.&rdquo;

~~Project Urbs will be a [[Tumblr]] clone of sorts, except that each post is essentially its own application, similar to [[HyperCard]].~~

This is no longer true, the above has been split into [[postwave]]. Urbs will be purely about application development, like a cross between Glitch and Itch.io.

## Design


<a id="orgb77114a"></a>

### Desired features

-   All posts are cards
-   Cards can be as simple as rich text and as complicated as an application
-   Cards are programmable with UrbsTalk
-   Cards need to be interactive
-   Must allow for drag-and-drop interface

## Possible names


<a id="orgd6616e5"></a>

### &ldquo;vcity&rdquo;

Pronounced like &ldquo;vee-sity&rdquo; or &ldquo;vis-it-ee&rdquo;.


<a id="org163ca17"></a>

### &ldquo;blogic&rdquo;

Seems to already be a minor brand. I like the use of &ldquo;logic&rdquo; though.


<a id="org36651cd"></a>

### &ldquo;udana&rdquo; or some variation

Take &ldquo;Xanadu&rdquo;, reverse it, and nix the &ldquo;X&rdquo;
