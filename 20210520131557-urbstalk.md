# UrbsTalk

tags
: [[my programming languages]]

UrbsTalk is the code name for the custom programming language used in Project Urbs. It is inspired by [[HyperTalk]].

Each UrbsTalk &ldquo;script&rdquo; is contained to a card, and even a component in a card at that.

Each component can have a label. The UI will be similar to Visual Basic Studio.
