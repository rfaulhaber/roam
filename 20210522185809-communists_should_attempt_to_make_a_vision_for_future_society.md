# communists should attempt to make a vision for future society

In the same vein of [[it is important for socialists to have a vision of the alternative]], communists should be able to attempt to answer the question &ldquo;what will communism be like?&rdquo;

This is something [[anarchists]] seem to be better at doing.

Some questions that are critical to answer:

-   Will there be a [[transition period]]?
-   Question of ownership
-   Question of consciousness
-   Question of [[planning]]
-   Question of efficiency
    -   Should avoid endless meetings
    -   Should be about maximizing free time
-   Question of markets
