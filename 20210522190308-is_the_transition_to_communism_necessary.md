# is the transition to communism necessary?

[[Communists]], in particular most types of [[Marxists]], tend to believe that a [[transition to communism]] is necessary, citing the complexity of [[capitalist]] production and infrastructure.

[[Anarchists]], on the other hand, tend to believe that there is no need for a transition and have a deep distrust of the idea, their logic broadly being a skepticism of the idea that one can control the mechanisms that capitalists use to dominate [[the working class]]
