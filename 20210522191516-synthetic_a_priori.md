# synthetic a priori

The synthetic _a priori_ is a term coined by [[Kant]] describing a type of [[judgment]]. This was his breakthrough thought.

A synthetic _a priori_ judgment is a judgment presupposed by the possibility of experience. For Kant, for example, causality was a synthetic _a priori_ judgment. If I throw a ball into the air, do I need to have done so to guess what will happen? Kant would say no, whereas [[David Hume]] would say yes.
