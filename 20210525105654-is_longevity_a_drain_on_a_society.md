# is longevity a drain on a society?

Inspired by [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/ant-tapeworm/618919/).

For me, I still think longevity is a worthwhile goal, however:

[[Longevity]] could be seen as a drain on society more broadly. The longer people live, the more resources they require to stay alive.

This is only a bad thing in a society where resources are scarce and where life is not valued.
