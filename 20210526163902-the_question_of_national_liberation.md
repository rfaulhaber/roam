# the question of national liberation

[[Israel]]/[[Palestine]] has been in the news recently, and it has brought up questions about the [[nation state]] and [[national liberation]]. When it comes to the question of [[colonialism]], there seem to be two options put forward:

## Waiting for communism

[[Anarchists]] and the like tend to put forward this option. The argument goes something like: &ldquo;there can be no international communism in a single state, and there can be no freedom in a single state, therefore every state must go at once.&rdquo;

While this may have some truth to it, it comes across as tasteless at best.

## Fighting for a nation state

### As an end

There is a certain current of [[Marxist-Leninist]] thought that postulates that the goal of [[decolonization]] is to simply build nation states, and that this is the goal in itself.

This should be criticized, in my opinion, because as communists I don&rsquo;t think we should be fighting to put the bourgeoisie in power per se. That said, especially in the case of Israel/Palestine, putting the Palestinian bourgeoisie in power would at least stop the apartheid.

### As a means to an end

This to me is the correct solution.

The construction of a nation state is merely a stopping point on the road to communism. As mentioned above, it would at least do away with the _colonial_ oppression of the Palestinians.

To me, this is most analogous to what the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] is to the [[1917 October Revolution]].
