# my legacy

Often times I think about what I&rsquo;m going to leave behind. I don&rsquo;t plan on having children, so what I leave behind is going to likely be more abstract. Among other things I&rsquo;d really like to think my Roam notes are my legacy. I will likely never publish a book but, with any luck, I&rsquo;ll have spent decades writing Roam notes trying to work out all the hard questions of life. And with any luck this will be my legacy.
