### Alienation from productive activity

The worker has no say in how their productive activity is used, it is at the mercy of the capitalist.

### Alienation from the product of their productive activity

Consider a factory worker. A factory worker produces items each day at work, but they do not have any control over this product.

### Alienation from other human beings

By being forced into a labor market, a person is forced into competition instead of cooperation with other human beings, making each person a team of one, creating a &ldquo;dog eat dog&rdquo; world, and workers collectively race to the bottom as a result.

### Alienation from potential for creativity and community with other human beings

Being forced to work, alienated from one&rsquo;s community every day means that individuals cannot as easily pursue their own interests and goals, and must sacrifice that for the sake of simply having to survive.
