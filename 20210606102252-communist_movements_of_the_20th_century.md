## History

Although there were [[social democratic]] parties in Germany and Russia at the start of the 20th century, the first proper &ldquo;communist&rdquo; movement could have been the [[Soviet Union]] born out of the [[1917 October Revolution]], led by the [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the [[Bolsheviks]].

With the failure of the [[German Revolution]], the Soviet Union was the only major communist power in the world until the end of the [[Second World War]], where the Soviets established a &ldquo;buffer zone&rdquo; between it and western Europe, creating the [[Eastern Bloc]] of powers, establishing about a dozen &ldquo;[[people&rsquo;s republics]]&rdquo;. [[Yugoslavia]] was the only one of these countries that had an independent socialist movement separate from the Soviet Union.

In 1947, [[China]] saw its own independent revolution communist revolution, creating the [[People&rsquo;s Republic of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]].

In 1959, the [[Cuban Revolution]] led to the establishment of the Republic of [[Cuba]] under [[Fidel Castro]]. Although the movement did not start as a communist one, it came to embrace communism and the leadership of the Soviet Union.

The Cuban Revolution was the last major communist revolution in the 20th century. [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] also had communist movements and their attempts at revolution lead to protracted engagements with the [[United States]], which spent much of the 20th century undermining communist movements.
