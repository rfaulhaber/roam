# is China capitalist?

The rise of [[China]] in the wake of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] has lead some on the left to ask if China is capitalist or not. I personally think this is a complex question and I will try to work it out here.

As of 06/07/2021, my answer is this: Yes, because of the tendency of China to develop capitalism, allow for private ownership, and the continued existence of commodity production and wage labor.

There is a similar question, which is &ldquo;is China socialist?&rdquo;, however when that question is asked it is often &ldquo;is China a liberatory force in the world?&rdquo;. Given that it would seem that China is a capitalist country, my answer woudl be &ldquo;no&rdquo; to this.
