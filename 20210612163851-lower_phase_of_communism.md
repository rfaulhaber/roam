# lower phase of communism

The lower phase of communism refers to the period right after a hypothetical communist [[revolution]], wherein proletarian power is established. The goals for the masses in this phase are to create a system whereby communism can be an intuitive way of life. The idea comes from [[Marx]] but was elaborated on by Lenin.

## The lower phase according to Lenin

[[Lenin]] believed that it was this phase where a [[state]] would safeguard common ownership of the means of production. Lenin writes in _The State and Revolution_:

> The first phase of communism, therefore, cannot yet provide justice and equality; differences, and unjust differences, in wealth will still persist, but the exploitation of man by man will have become impossible because it will be impossible to seize the means of production&#x2013;the factories, machines, land, etc.&#x2013;and make them private property. &#x2014; V. I. Lenin, [The State and Revolution](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm)

Further, Lenin writes that:

> [[The state withers away]] insofar as there are no longer any capitalists, any classes, and, consequently, no class can be suppressed.

## Criticism of Lenin

Critics of Lenin would argue that the goal of the lower phase of communism is actually to undo differences in wealth. The Dutch communists argued that this is necessary (and could be solved with [[labor-time accounting]]).

## Goal

The goal of the lower phase of communism ought to be the conscious establishment of a way of life and mode of production alternative to capitalism that is as intuitive as how capitalism operates.
