# the masses are more revolutionary than parties

There is a phenomeon in the course of [[revolutions]] that the general masses are more advanced politically than the revolutionary parties. Some examples include:

-   The German workers in the days of the aftermath of the [[German Revolution]]
-   The spontaneous action that kicked off the [[1917 October Revolutton]]
-   Organized labor in general

This was also something that [[Mao]] noticed and perhaps appreciated more than most revolutionaries (however even he could not stay ahead of the masses).

Historically, this has also been a massive miscalculation on the part of revolutionary organizations. Arguably, the [[Soviet Union]] lost favor simply because it failed to meet the demands of its citizens. The government of Robespierre collapsed in part because they lost favor with the French people at the time.

In general, people in the aggregate seem to know what they want, and know what they don&rsquo;t want. They have a sense of the problems in their world, but perhaps don&rsquo;t know how best to articulate it. Perhaps this is the [[role of a communist party]].
