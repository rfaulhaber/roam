# Twin Peaks was one of the first narrative-driven TV shows

This idea comes from [this](https://soundcloud.com/whytheory/twin-peaks-the-return) episode of [[Why Theory]].

Many [[TV]] shows prior to [[Twin Peaks]] were self-contained. Shows didn&rsquo;t have a sense of &ldquo;memory.&rdquo; There was never any overarching narrative, and this allowed the viewer to simply turn on any random episode, allowing them to jump in wherever. This was impacted by _how_ people watched TV at the time. Many people didn&rsquo;t record TV or have a means to watch TV at will, like they do now.

Twin Peaks was maybe the first TV show to violate this convention by creating an overaching narrative, thereby turning the TV show into a multi-part movie.
