# it is idealist to fit the world to your model

In [[Marxism]], as well as other leftist theorizing, you&rsquo;ll find people essentially trying to fit complex social phenomenon into simple concepts. To do this is [[idealist]]. [[Marx]] himself began his research project by looking out at the world and making statements about what was there. He did not say &ldquo;the world behaves in X manner&rdquo; and _a postiori_ justified it.

If we are to be [[materialists]], we must first understand how the world works and derive models and concepts _from that_.
