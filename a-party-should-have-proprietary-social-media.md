# A party should have proprietary social media

This idea comes from [this episode](https://regrettablecentury.buzzsprout.com/220523/8334735-the-internet-was-a-mistake-surveillance-capitalism-and-the-public-private-tech-panopticon) of the Regrettable Century.

Should a hypothetical communist party have its own proprietary social media for organizing? Access to this form of social media could be granted and revoked with party membership.

This seems like a possible vector for abuse. Who moderates it? What would stop party heads from just deleting posts they don&rsquo;t like?
