# abductive reasoning

Abductive reasoning is a type of reasoning that, in contrast to [[inductive reasoning]] or [[deductive reasoning]], seeks to find gaps in major premises and understand how they follow. This has been a focus of modern research, where one&rsquo;s research project is simply finding the gaps in thought between two research concepts.

Unlike deductive or inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning only provides a &ldquo;most likely&rdquo; explanation, and leaves room for doubt.
