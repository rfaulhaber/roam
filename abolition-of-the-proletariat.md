# abolition of the proletariat

The abolition of the [[proletariat]] is one of the goals of [[communism]]. More specifically, the goal is the **self**-abolition of the proletariat.

The proletariat are the class in society that makes society work: [[workers only have their labor-power to sell]]. This implies that a proletarian is dependent on [[wage labor]]. Therefore, in order to create a classless society, the goals should not be to create a &ldquo;proletarian state&rdquo; but for the self-abolition of the proletariat itself, as a &ldquo;proletarian state&rdquo; is not the abolition of classes, but the maintenence of wage labor.
