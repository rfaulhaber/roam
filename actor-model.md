The actor model is a programming paradigm, like [[object-oriented programming]], wherein a network of **actors** communicate by sending messages to one another.

Each actor has a message queue, and communicate by sending messages back and forth asynchronously. Actors can create more actors as well as handle messages by updating their own state. This new state will be viewable to all future messages.

The actor model originated from the [[Erlang]] programming language.
