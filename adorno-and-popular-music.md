# Adorno and popular music

[[Adorno]] criticized [[popular music]] for being yet another [[commodity]]. He criticized the music of his time as having melodies that could be categorized, such as &ldquo;happy music&rdquo; or &ldquo;sad music&rdquo;, and that modern popular music was just composable of these reusable elements. Like the physical commodities produced by industrial capitalist society, music could be made in a factory.
