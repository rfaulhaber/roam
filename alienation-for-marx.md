# alienation for Marx



## Alienation in Estranged Labor

[[Marx]]&rsquo;s conception of alienation, as defined in his work &ldquo;[Estranged Labor](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm)&rdquo;, is as follows:


### Alienation from productive activity

The worker has no say in how their productive activity is used, it is at the mercy of the capitalist.


### Alienation from the product of their productive activity

Consider a factory worker. A factory worker produces items each day at work, but they do not have any control over this product.


### Alienation from other human beings

By being forced into a labor market, a person is forced into competition instead of cooperation with other human beings, making each person a team of one, creating a &ldquo;dog eat dog&rdquo; world, and workers collectively race to the bottom as a result.


### Alienation from potential for creativity and community with other human beings

Being forced to work, alienated from one&rsquo;s community every day means that individuals cannot as easily pursue their own interests and goals, and must sacrifice that for the sake of simply having to survive.


## Alienation in [[Capital]]

Thinkers like [[Althusser]] believe that Marx gave up alienation by the time Capital was written. However it is my opinion that alienation is actually one of the core ideas of _Capital_. Marx mentions [[commodity fetishism]] in the first chapter, which itself is a more specific kind of alienation. Further, everything Marx describes; wage labor, working conditions, etc. all describe a kind of alienation.
