# alienation

Alienation refers to estrangement in some form or another.

As it relates to [[communism]], we should also ask: [[should we abolish alienation?]]


## Hegel

Alienation comes from [[Hegel]], which, for him, was the recognition of the other. Hegel believed that freedom could come from alienation.

Alienation was also seen for Hegel as the separation of man from God, and that the only way humankind can come to know itself is through the separation from God. This idea seems to have been derived from [[hermetics]].


## [[Marx]]

[[Marx]] mostly spoke of alienation as it pertained to [[labor]] (&ldquo;estranged labor&rdquo;). This idea later developed into the concept of [[commodity fetishism]].


## Lacan


## Sartre


## Heidegger


## Misc

[[Slavoj Zizek]] says somewhere that in [[communism]] he wants just &ldquo;an acceptable amount of alienation.&rdquo;
