# anarcho-primitivism

A current within [[anarchism]] that blames not only [[modernity]] but [[civilization]] itself for the problems we face, that [[agriculture]] was humanity&rsquo;s fall from grace. Thus, the solution should be to return to something pre-agrarian.

Anarcho-primitivism is also often associated with critiques of [[technology]], and that all tech is inherently an expression of power relations.

I&rsquo;m not sure to what extent _all_ anprims believe this.

I am not an anarcho-primitivist.
