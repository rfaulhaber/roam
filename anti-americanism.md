# Anti-Americanism

It is sometimes said that anti-Americanism is the [[anti-imperialism]] of fools.

There is an attitude, especially those most active online, of being _only_ anti-American. While it&rsquo;s true that [[America is the global hegemon]], that&rsquo;s really the biggest problem with the [[United States]] currently. Much of the US&rsquo;s current status is based on this fact.

You also see a phenomenon I like to refer to as [[foreign policy contrarianism]]:, where people&rsquo;s foreign policy opinions are simply the negation of the popular one.
