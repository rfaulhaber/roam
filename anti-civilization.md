# anti-civilization

A political current which postulates that [[civilization]] itself is the source of all domination and hierarchy. This is usually associated with, but not limited to, [[anarcho-primitivism]].

To be anti-civilization implies a number of things. Some anti-civs consider [[capitalism]] and civilization synonymous, while others believe that we must return to hunter-gatherer society, and perhaps even abolish [[consciousness]] itself. It is nebulous.
