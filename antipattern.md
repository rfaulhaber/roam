# antipattern

Antipatterns are patterns of programming that are considered to lead to difficult to modify programs. One of the [[characteristics of good programs]] is [[software maintainability]], and antipatterns usually cut against this in some way.

The [C2 Wiki contains a catalog of antipatterns](https://wiki.c2.com/?AntiPatternsCatalog).
