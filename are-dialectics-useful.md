# Are dialectics useful?

[[Marx]], in his writings, frequently refers to [[dialectics]] in some form or another. This is something he inherits from [[Hegel]], and some would argue something he developed out of [[idealism]] in to [[dialectical materialism]].

Some see Marx&rsquo;s dialectics as the key to understanding not only Marx but the secret key to understanding everything, that dialectics are the thing Marx used to produce his profound insights on [[capitalism]].

Some might say that [[dialectics]] is the first grasp at something like [[systems thinking]]. [[Engels]] says in [[Anti-DÃ¼hring]] that there is a need for a new dialectical science, and this could have been the first grasp at something like systems theory, and that a science of systems would surpass the need for an understanding of dialectics.

Often, Marx&rsquo;s &ldquo;dialectics&rdquo; usually describe a mutual interdependence.
