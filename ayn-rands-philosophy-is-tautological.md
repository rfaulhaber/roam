# Ayn Rand's philosophy is tautological

: [[Ayn Rand]] [[objectivism]] [[philosophy]]

Ayn Rand derived many of her philosophical ideas from the law of identity, that A = A. Indeed this is true, but it doesn&rsquo;t say much that&rsquo;s useful. That did not stop her from trying.

> Since his baptism in medieval times, Aristotle has served many strange purposes. None have been odder than this sacramental alliance, so to speak, of Aristotle with Adam Smith. The extraordinary virtues Miss Rand finds in the law that A is A suggests that she is unaware that logical principles by themselves can test only consistency. They cannot establish truth. [&#x2026;] Swearing fidelity to Aristotle, Miss Rand claims to deduce not only matters of fact from logic but, with as little warrant, ethical rules and economic truths as well. As she understands them, the laws of logic license her in proclaiming that “existence exists,” which is very much like saying that the law of gravitation is heavy and the formula of sugar is sweet.
