# big data

&ldquo;Big data&rdquo; is a neologism referring to the mass collection, storage, and organization of data. Such data is usually gathered by independent firms while interacting with apps, but in recent years, law enforcement has started using big data using their own data.

Data collected may include interaction with apps, but also includes personal details as well, and so much so that firms can deduce personal information based purely on your interaction with apps.

A precondition for big data is [[the commodification of data]].
