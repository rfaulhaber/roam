# capitalism as a form of domination

[[Domination]], which could be seen as a subset of power, and being a specific kind of power relation, is all-present through out [[capitalism]]. This is the main thrust of new bodies of [[Marx]] scholarship pioneered by people like [[Michael Heinrich]].

Capitalism is a form of domination because it is capable of silently compelling its subjects into behavior. By restricting the choices of its subjects, by forcing them to interact with the market, by not allowing [[social reproduction]] to occur outside the terms of the market, capitalism ends up creating a system of domination.
