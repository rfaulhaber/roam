# capitalism commodified time

One of the great &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; of [[capitalism]] is the way that it commodified time itself through the process of [[abstract labor]] and [[labor-power]]: workers do not sell their labor, or even what they produce, but they sell their _time_.

This is why some [[communists]] believe in the [[abolition of time]].
