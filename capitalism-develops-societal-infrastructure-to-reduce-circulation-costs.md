Capitalism is always seeking to reduce and eliminate the cost of commodities having to be physically moved from one place to another, therefore capitalism tends to develop means of transportation and communication to reduce such costs. Roads, highways, air freight, etc. are all externalized costs to production, but are otherwise necessary for the production and circulation process.
