# capitalism is totalizing

: [[behavior of capitalism]]

Capitalism, unlike other modes of production, subordinates other modes of production it comes in contact with, and will even eradicate other modes of production so as to spread itself. The logic of other modes of production become subordinate to it: workers in non-capitalist societies must work rationally and more productively to keep up and compete with capitalism, for example.

Capitalism is not only totalizing literally, as in it destroys the competition, but it becomes totalizing in the lives and minds of people who live under it. In the modern era, capitalism quite literally effects our way of thinking about society, so much so [[that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine anything else]].
