[[Capitalism]], which emerges out of European [[feudalism]], was not planned. Eventually, the [[system]]-logic arose from the conditions of feudalism and a new order emerged. Understanding that capitalism was not a conscious choice but the development of a new _system_ will help in understanding how we can move past it.
