# cars create an adverse environment

Driving is a competition for space on the road. The more cars on the road, the harder it is to go anywhere. This could be an explanation for [[road rage]].

From:

> Something that never clicked for me until I read Planka.nu is that driving puts you in a completely different psychological mindset than using public transit. “Road rage” exists because when everyone is in their own car trying to get somewhere, they are competing with all of the other cars for space- the more cars there are on the road, the harder it is for you to get where you’re going. But when you’re riding a bus or a train, you’re going the same direction as all of the other passengers in a single vehicle, which creates a fundamentally cooperative frame of mind- you’re all in the same situation. Cars turn people against each other
