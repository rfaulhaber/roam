# characteristics of good software design

This is the billion dollar question! What makes good software? This could be answered in two ways, and I don&rsquo;t think these are two entirely unrelated questions:


## 1. What is well-engineered software?

1.  [[Software maintainability]]: Every piece of software should require little effort to maintain.


## 2. What is good consumer software?

This is a big question. What do consumers want? Is [[Emacs]] good consumer software? Or do general consumers prefer things like [[Windows]]?
