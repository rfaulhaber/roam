# class consciousness is a perspective error

The problem with the idea of class consciousness is that it assumes that someone can know &ldquo;true&rdquo; consciousness, unaffected by any other material forces. This is simply not true. We are limited by our material conditions, and we have a very difficult time seeing beyond them.

It is common for Marxists in particular to act like, because they are Marxists and have a Marxist perspective, they can see beyond the current situation in an objective manner. This is wrong, but that isn&rsquo;t to say that a Marxist perspective is useless. We just have to understand that we aren&rsquo;t objectively correct.
