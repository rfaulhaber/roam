# class consciousness

Class consciousness is an idea popular among [[communists]]. It is the idea that a class in itself understands its role in the system. The &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; here refers to, say, the working class&rsquo;s overall understanding that they are the bottom rung of the capitalist system.

One might argue that [[class consciousness is a perspective error]].


## Criticism

Basically, it&rsquo;s a perspective error that says &ldquo;being a Marxist, I know what true consciousness is.&rdquo;
