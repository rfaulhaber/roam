# commodities are stamped with the logic of the society that produces them

In [[capitalism]], [[commodity production]] produces [[commodities]] that are stamped with the logic of the society that produces them.

For example, moving pictures were invented with the intention of being able to train workers faster. The guillotine was a machine invented with one very specific purpose. Video game consoles were built to play games that individuals would spend lots of money on over a long period of time.

All commodities, as are all products throughout society, are stamped with this kind of logic.

The task for future societies would then be to create products that reduce [[alienation]] and oppression, and otherwise enhance freedom as much as possible.
