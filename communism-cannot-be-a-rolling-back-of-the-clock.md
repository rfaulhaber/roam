# communism cannot be a rolling back of the clock

When discussing nearly anything as it pertains to accomplishing [[communism]], a few things must be borne in mind:

-   There are now over 8 billion people on the planet. Mass death is unacceptable in a transition.
-   To prevent mass death, we cannot simply wind back the clock on a lot of things. Industrial society, for all of its very serious and genuine faults, cannot be immediately rolled back.
    -   This is especially true as it pertains to [[agriculture]]: transitioning to a communal agricultural program overnight would lead to mass death

The goal of the [[transition period]] therefore must be to balance these things: we must actually take steps to transition to communism while preventing mass death and maintaining approval of the masses
