# communist mode of production

The communist mode of production, for the most part, has a negative definition: it is not generalized commodity production (i.e. [[capitalism]]), it does not have money, it does not have a state, it does not have wage labor, and so on. That said I don&rsquo;t think communism is simply the negation of capitalism, although I do think its proper definition is just as tenuous.
