# communist organizations are subject to the same group dynamics as other organizations

: [[organizations]] [[communist party]]

Communist parties themselves are just subsets of organizations broadly. Since communist organizations are made up of people, the same group dynamics apply as they would in a church or a business. Ideology doesn&rsquo;t seem to make much of a difference. An example of this is the phenomenon of a [[cult of personality]], which seems to exist regardless of ideology.
