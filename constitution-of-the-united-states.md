# Constitution of the United States

The Constitution of the [[United States]] is a [[constitution]], the founding document of the nation. It describes how the government should work and how it should relate to its citizens.

It is often seen as a kind of [[contract]] between the citizens and the government.

It enshrines basic rights of its citizens, including the right to free speech and free association.

Some would say that its a living document, however it&rsquo;s clear that even by the 1820s the Constitution&rsquo;s faults were showing. Even today, the Constitution makes the United States government absolutely rigid and slow to change. Some would say that [[this is the point]].
