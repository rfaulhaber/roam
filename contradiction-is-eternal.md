# contradiction is eternal

Is it possible to live in a world without [[contradiction]]? As [[science]] has progressed, it would seem that the answer is no: that for every stone that&rsquo;s overturned there will always be more waiting. Even if [[capitalism]] was overthrown, there would still be struggles and problems to overcome. Is this not what contradiction is?

What would it even mean to live in a world without contradiction?
