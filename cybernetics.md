# cybernetics

Cybernetics is the cross-disciplinary study of using [[systems]] of control for desired ends.

The term &ldquo;cybernetics&rdquo; comes from the Greek word &ldquo;κυβερνήτης&rdquo; (kubernetes).


## History

Cybernetics developed out of operational research done by the British and American governments during the [[Second World War]]. The term was coined by [[Norbert Weiner]].

Around the time that computing became more mainstream, cybernetics became a distinct field from [[artificial intelligence]], where previously it was the same field (see: [[split between cybernetics and artificial intelligence]]).
