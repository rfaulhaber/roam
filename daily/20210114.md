-   Kautsky believed that imperialism would gradually move to a period where imperialist powers would exploit the third world collectively rather than competitively and individually. This is why Lenin called his book on imperialism &ldquo;the highest stage of capitalism&rdquo;, because he rejected the idea that capitalism would move into a new era of imperialism. History shows that Kautsky was correct, though. ([[link]])
