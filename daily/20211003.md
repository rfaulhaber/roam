-   Marx believed that the basis of value was social and not concrete, unlike prior thinkers
-   fetishism shows that there&rsquo;s more to the world than what is directly observable, and it must be overcome. fetishism could be seen as a critique of empiricism, you need more than empirical research to understand what&rsquo;s going on
-   it is more important to be a communist than a marxist
-   the law of value is operating in china
-   the Soviet union and China have turned out to not be emancipatory projects
-   taking state power is only the first step, and any communist movement that holds power for its own sake is not a liberatory one
-   those who say that china is communist because the bourgeoisie do are on the same side as the bourgeoisie. this attitude does not say anything worthwhile
