## [[Regrettable Century]] notes

-   The left defines itself in opposition so much so that the thing that it fears most is having power
-   that is to say that power is an object a for the left: a desire that it gets enjoyment out of not having
-   &ldquo;the only thing worse than not having it is having it&rdquo; (a description of [[objet a]])
