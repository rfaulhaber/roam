## [[Why Theory]] notes

-   to tell the story retroactively is to tell it with a cut. That is to say that it is framed
-   telling things in a linear way is to frame a particular narrative. Retroactivity allows space for &ldquo;but&rdquo; when telling the story backwards or informed by the present
-   dialectics is about the moments where time seems to be interrupted, the break
-   look up story about Freud, patient Emma, shopkeepers laughing at her
-   for zizek, freedom is defined by retroactivity
