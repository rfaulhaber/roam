> Mr. [[Eduard Bernstein]] submitted to me a manuscript by [[Engels]] of scientific content with the request that I express my opinion as to whether this manuscript should be printed. My opinion is as follows: If this manuscript were to originate from an author of no interest as a historical personality, I would not advise publication; for the content is of no special interest, either from the point of view of modern physics or even for the history of physics. On the other hand, I can imagine that this text would be considered for publication as it forms an interesting contribution toward the illumination of Engelsâ€™ intellectual personality.
