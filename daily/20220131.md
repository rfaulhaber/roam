> Mr. [[Eduard Bernstein]] submitted to me a manuscript by [[Engels]] of scientific content with the request that I express my opinion as to whether this manuscript should be printed. My opinion is as follows: If this manuscript were to originate from an author of no interest as a historical personality, I would not advise publication; for the content is of no special interest, either from the point of view of modern physics or even for the history of physics. On the other hand, I can imagine that this text would be considered for publication as it forms an interesting contribution toward the illumination of Engelsâ€™ intellectual personality.

## [[Varn Vlog]] notes

-   efficiency is work / energy input
-   systems are brittle when they take on too much stress and break
-   brittleness is related to cascade failure
-   centralization doesn&rsquo;t lead to efficiency necessarily. centralization requires more energy input
-   deleuze and guattari believed that capitalism was rhizomatic (like grass, nodes in the system were expendable because the whole system was so diffuse)
-   deleuze did not account for agency in the system
-   we don&rsquo;t evolve for efficiency we evolve for survival
-   debates over centralization have to take into account this energy efficiency


## [[Regrettable Century]] notes

-   evidence of capitalism starts in the Italian city states in the 1100s
-   Banaji believes that capital can even be found as early as Rome
-   after the collapse of Rome taxes were still collected in the same way
-   in Rome, the weakened metal base of the currency meant that it was unreliable outside of the empire
-   Roman society was big on manumission, and one tension the late empire faced was the fact that it wasn&rsquo;t getting new slaves because it had stopped expanding
-   Roman slavery was not chattel slavery
-   Roman slaves ended up become tenants
-   Serfdom involves an agreement to a lord, that the subject must hand over some kind of extraction to the lord, and the lord in exchange offers protection
-   Peasants don&rsquo;t have bonds, serfs do
-   Sheriffs initially were for tax collection purposes
-   Most of the time punishments were physical, imprisonment was pretty rare
-   European punishments were relatively rare in general
-   Absolutism and divine right of kings were ideas of modernity, not the feudal era
