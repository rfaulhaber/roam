## [[Antifada]] notes

-   if there must be a Marxist humanism it must be about the human role as both a species (i.e. an active part of a greater world system) and something that is an active and conscious participant in said system. The practical unity between the human and the animal world.
-   Humanity is the &ldquo;social brain&rdquo;, the sum of all conscious human knowledge.
-   communism is as much an anthropological revolution as a political one
-   communism will undo the metabolic rift
