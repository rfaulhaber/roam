> There are two kinds of [[consequentialism]]. The first is the naive “[[ends justify the means]]” kind that ends up being used as a pretext for all sorts of atrocities, but collapses under even the simplest thought experiments. The second is the tautological kind, which tells you that the best possible outcome will be produced by following an [[ethical]] system based on values and principles, invented by people who actually understand ethics.
