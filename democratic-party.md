# Democratic Party

The Democratic Party of the United States is the oldest [[political party]] in the world. It was formed by [[Andrew Jackson]] after the breakup of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] founded by [[Thomas Jefferson]], and was seen as the successor. They are one of two major political parties in the United States.

The Democrats were initially about the [[republicanism]] politics of [[yeoman]]s in the [[United States]]: that is that they favored a weak federal government and states&rsquo; rights. As such, as time went on, they became synonymous with pro-[[slavery]], and many of the people who formed the [[Confederate States of America]] were Democrats.

As yeomans came to disappear from the political scene, and as slavery was abolished, the Democrats came to represent a [[working class]] politics with the presidency of [[FDR]].

Today, the Democrats represent coastal elite interests: the interests of [[Silicon Valley]] and [[finance capital]], and only ostensibly support progressive politics in name.
