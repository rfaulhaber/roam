# dialectical materialism

Dialectical materialism was, first and foremost, the official [[ideology]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. It is a [[materialist]] [[philosophy]] that has its roots in the thought of [[Karl Marx]].

It is also known as &ldquo;dimat&rdquo; or &ldquo;diamat&rdquo;.

Personally, from a functional perspective, I feel that dialectical materialism is mystifying at best and an ideological bludgeon at worst. I find very little value in dialectical materialism.
