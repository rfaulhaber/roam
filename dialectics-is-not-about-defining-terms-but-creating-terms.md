# dialectics is not about defining terms but creating terms

A common complaint of reading [[Marx]] is that he does not define his terms upfront. According to Derrick Varn, Marx said that &ldquo;he did not want to write a single sentence that could be left for interpretation.&rdquo; The joke is on him.

Dialectics in the ancient Greek world was not about defining terms, because a dialectic was used when the term itself was in question. The result of the dialectic was supposed to be axiomatic logic.

For [[Hegel]], dialectics became something where terms could emerge out of. Marx makes use of this in nearly all of his later writing, where he does not define terms like &ldquo;capitalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;working class&rdquo; but instead _describes_ them. [[Capital Vol. 1]] for example does not contain many definitions outright, but an intense interrogation of terms.
