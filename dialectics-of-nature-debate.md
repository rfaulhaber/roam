# dialectics of nature debate

The so-called &ldquo;Dialectics of Nature debate&rdquo; is a debate among [[communists]] over [[Engels]]&rsquo;s [[Dialectics of Nature]] work. It can be summarized as &ldquo;Is [[communism]] a worldview? Does communism touch everything? And is socialism scientific?&rdquo;

I generally deny so-called worldview Marxism, and I reject the dialectics of nature.
