# edwad's criticism of fundamental principles of communist production and distribution

[[edwad]] criticised the [[Fundamental Principles of Communist Production and Distribution]] as not being adequately thought out. The issue, he said, is that they want to do [[capitalism]] without [[money]], and that you cannot simply abolish and replace money as though moeny doesn&rsquo;t provide a social function.
