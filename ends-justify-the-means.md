# ends justify the means

&ldquo;The ends justify the means&rdquo; is an [[ethical]] statement which implies that intentions are all that matter. If the end is a greater good than the means to achieve it then it is worthwhile.

As I get older I&rsquo;m not sure that I believe that the end always justify the means, for the means tend to shape the character of the end, and I&rsquo;m not sure if this is the kind of world I&rsquo;d like to live in.

For example, it&rsquo;s argued by [[Leninists]] that mass terror was required to achieve [[communism]]. If this is true, such terror ended up shaping the character of the Soviet state, to the detriment of its population.

As [[Zizek]] says somewhere:

> If we are told we need to break a few eggs to get an omelette, I would at least like to see the omelette.
