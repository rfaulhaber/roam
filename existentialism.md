# existentialism

Existentialism is a group of [[philosophical]] thought that can be seen as a reaction to [[Hegel]]. Major contributors include [[Nietzsche]], [[Kierkegaard]], and, more recently, [[Sartre]].

It is sometimes considered to be limited to just a cultural or aesthetic movement, as existentialism often played out in works of fiction rather than in philosophical tracts.
