The different parts of [[industrial capital]] that Marx outlines in Vol. 2 are not all handled by one firm. Capital is a systemic relation, therefore there are can be different firms that handle different parts of the capital circuit. For example, banks and financiers handle the money capital phase.

In [[Capital Vol. 2]], however, Marx does not distinguish between these because to do so would obfuscate his point (according to Harvey).
