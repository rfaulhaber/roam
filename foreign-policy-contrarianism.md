# foreign policy contrarianism

This is a phenomenon where people take popular [[foreign policy]] opinions and simply invert them. This is common on the [[left]] / among [[communists]].

The general template for such contrarianism usually takes the form of &ldquo;We, as socialists, must support X country because they are an enemy of the [[United States]].&rdquo;

Although as socialists I don&rsquo;t think we should actively call for US intervention in such countries, but I also don&rsquo;t think that means we need to defend the honor of the [[Iranian]] government, for example, which is a reactionary and conservative theocracy. Personally, I am not interested in defending such a government on its own merits.

A further line of argumentation you&rsquo;ll get is &ldquo;well, if you say anything negative about X enemy of the US during this time, you&rsquo;re just doing the CIA&rsquo;s work for it.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think the [[CIA]] really cares about what I have to say about Iran or Venezuela. Nor do I think my political opponents, who are right wingers, would use my own arguments against X country.
