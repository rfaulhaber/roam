# freedom

Initially, I wrote that I would spend the rest of my life trying to answer the question of what freedom is. However, now, I think there are a few approaches to answering this question.

I would consider freedom to ultimately be a situation wherein everyone is capable of living without [[domination]]. At some point in human history, humans were free. Now, we are not.

However, most would consider freedom and [[liberty]] mutually interchangeable. As a communist, I am uninterested in liberty, as liberty is the right to do things within the context of a liberal [[state]]. Liberty might therefore be considered a subset of freedom.

Freedom, if defined as freedom from domination, then, is something broader.
