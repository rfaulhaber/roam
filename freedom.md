What is freedom?


## Freedom is freedom from care or worry

Being able to live your life care-free, without worrying day-to-day where, say, your next meal is coming from, as is in the case in [[capitalism]], is a sort of freedom. Billionaires are able to live such lives to some degree, though even though money is not a concern for them, they are still constrained by the logic of capital.
