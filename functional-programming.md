-   functional programming is a way of writing code by means of pure functions
-   benefits of functional programming:
    1.  Immutability
        -   All values derived from old values
    2.  Testability
        -   Pure functions are easy to test
-   difficulties of functional programming:
    1.  unintuivive
        -   many people learn programming either imperatively or in an object-oriented manner
    2.  impractical?
        -   interfacing with &ldquo;the real world&rdquo; is challenging
