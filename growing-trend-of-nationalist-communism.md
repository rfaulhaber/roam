# growing trend of nationalist communism

Recently, online, I&rsquo;ve noticed a growing trend of self-described [[communists]] who are increasingly [[nationalist]]. Although they describe themselves as communists, they seem to not adhere to the goal of the [[the Communist horizon]], and believe that [[state socialism]], especially that of the 20th century, is essentially the goal of the communist movement. It seems to be mostly a characteristic of [[social media]].

I find this concerning because these people seem to consider nationalist projects &ldquo;good enough.&rdquo; Compared to life in the [[United States]] currently, I could understand why one might look fondly at the [[Soviet Union]]. However, the goal of communists is not simply state socialism but for the self-[[abolition of the proletariat]], the state, and money itself.
