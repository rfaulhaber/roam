In _Automation and the Future of Work_ Benanav makes the case that automation has been growing in the first world not as a means of increasing productivity but as a cost-saving measure in the face of [[deindustrialization]]. Overcapacity in the manufacturing sector of the global north led to deindustrialization, and automation allows firms to stay competitive while shedding their workforces. This comes hand-in-hand with [[globalization]] as well.
