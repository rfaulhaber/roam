# Impact of the Agricultural Revolution on Industry. The Creation of a Home Market for Industrial Capital | Capital Vol. 1



## Notes

-   The peasant was transformed into the proletarian, in short, by being cast off his land and having his means of subsistence taken from him, and sold back to him via wages by his new lord, the industrial capitalist
-   Over time, the following process occurs: some amount of peasantry is expelled from the land and forced to work in factories. This removes all the small producers and concentrates them into once producer, working under a capitalist. On the one hand, this produces constant capital, as there are peasants left behind to produce said raw materials, and variable capital, i.e. the freed peasantry.
-   This process that Marx is describing creates the &ldquo;domestic industry&rdquo; that Marx has previously talked about.
