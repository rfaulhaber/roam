# impersonal domination

Impersonal domination describes the kind of [[domination]] that is prevalent under [[capitalism]]. It is distinct from its much more familiar cousin, personal domination, wherein one person rules over others. Personal domination was popular throughout much of human history until the advent of capitalism. One of the difficult problems of capitalism is describing how domination continues to exist, despite its nominal non-existence. This is also in contrast to much of human history.

Impersonal domination, then, describes how people are dominated not by _people_ but by things created by people, such as commodities (e.g. [[commodity fetishism]]) or processes.
