# insurrectionism

Also called &ldquo;insurrectionary [[anarchism]]&rdquo;.

A political current in [[anarchism]] that contrasts insurrection with [[revolutionary]] ends. Small affinity groups and autonomous cells would coordinate insurrections against the state rather than build a large, sweeping revolution. The original idea, though, would be that such insurrection would inspire or lead to a revolution.

I don&rsquo;t think history has borne this idea out. Individual terrorism and insurrection has usually not led to greater revolution or otherwise larger social upheaval, it has only shed the blood of otherwise would-be revolutionaries.
