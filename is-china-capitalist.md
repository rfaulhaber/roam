# is China capitalist?

The rise of [[China]] in the wake of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] has lead some on the left to ask if China is capitalist or not. I personally think this is a complex question and I will try to work it out here.

As of 09/25/2021, my answer is this: Yes, because of the tendency of China to develop capitalism, allow for private ownership, and the continued existence of commodity production and wage labor.

There is a similar question, which is &ldquo;is China socialist?&rdquo;, however when that question is asked it is often &ldquo;is China a liberatory force in the world?&rdquo;. Given that it would seem that China is a capitalist country, my answer woudl be &ldquo;no&rdquo; to this.


## Is capitalist

-   Continued existence of commodity production and wage labor
-   Has and maintains capitalist class
    -   The communist party of China may not themselves be bourgeois, but the Chinese state is influenced by capital. Otherwise they would not need to adjust their currency. They also foster a [[developmentalist]] model
-   Increasingly has a [[business cycle]]
-   Important circuit in global capital. Not necessarily peripheral but still plays important role in global capital


## Is not capitalist

-   Has regulated economy
    -   [[socialism is more than just state power]]
-   Does not benefit from [[imperialism]]
