# is consciousness simply social?

Without social contact, do humans have consciousness? Are the [[id]], [[ego]], and [[super-ego]] socially imposed?

[[Freud]] felt that the [[super-ego]] was something external to a person. But are all three registers, maybe except the id, socially imposed?

What I can say for sure is that a person completely cut off from social contact cannot survive.
