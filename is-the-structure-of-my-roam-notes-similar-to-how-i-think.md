# is the structure of my roam notes similar to how I think?

I wonder if the way these notes are structured is similar to how I think. Many of my notes are concepts.

These notes could double as an encyclopedia in some cases.

I&rsquo;d like to think that I think a lot about the way such concepts interact, but I don&rsquo;t feel that that&rsquo;s adequately captured here quite yet.
