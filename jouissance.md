# jouissance

Jouissance is a [[psychoanalytic]] concept developed out of the pleasure principle. The term comes from [[Lacan]], who used it to mean a kind of secret pleasure seeking. Neil Gorman describes it as an &ldquo;addiction&rdquo; related to the physical sensation of pleasure.

Jouissance is a bit like eating donuts: you enjoy eating them but you know they&rsquo;re bad for you, and if you over-indulge they&rsquo;ll cause problems for you.
