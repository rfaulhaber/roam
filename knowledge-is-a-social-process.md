# knowledge is a social process

Knowledge is necessarily a social process: everything that we know about the world was either discovered by us or someone else. Everything we know is the result of the process of millennia of work to understand the world.

For example, you can take it on faith that the world is round because you can mathematically prove that the world is round. (Even being able to mathematically prove something is the result of the social process of knowledge)

I believe this is what [[Hegel]] and [[Bogdanov]], in some way or another, believed as well.
