# left communism

Left communism is the &ldquo;left deviation&rdquo; of [[Orthodox Marxism]]. Left communists are usually critical of Russian communism and formed in opposition to it.

Left communism refers to the &ldquo;left&rdquo; of the Marxist center, e.g. the [[Comintern]]. Historically, left communists were very critical of the [[Soviet Union]] and historical [[Marxism-Leninism]].

There are two main strains of left communism: the strain that came out of Dutch communism ([[council communism]]), and the strain that came out of Italian Communism (see [[Bordiga]]).

The main differences between left communism and, say, [[Orthodox Marxism]], [[Marxism-Leninism]], or [[social democracy]], include:

-   Communists should not participate in parliamentary democracy
-   Communists should not engage in [[activism]]
-   Opposition to [[Stalinism]]

Left communists are generally &ldquo;Leninist&rdquo; but not Marxist-Leninist.

The term &ldquo;left communism&rdquo; came from [[Lenin]]&rsquo;s pamphlet, &ldquo;[[Left-Wing Communism: An Infintile Disorder]]&rdquo;. Similarly, sometimes left communists are referred to as &ldquo;[[ultra-leftists]]&rdquo;.
