# left-wing myopia

[[Left-wing]] myopia is a term I&rsquo;ve come up with to describe the inability for leftists, particularly those in [[online spaces]], to see beyond their own understanding of the world. There&rsquo;s very often a tendency for online leftists to believe that, because they have read the [[Big Beards]] they have the skeleton key to understanding how the world works. This is not true! And this is something that should be actively challenged.
