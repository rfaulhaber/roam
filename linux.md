# Linux

Linux is a [[free]] and [[open source]] [[operating system]] that began as a clone of [[Unix]].

Unlike other popular operating systems, Linux is not one coherent type of system, but is instead made up of different [[distros]], which come with the Linux kernel as well as different user space software. For example, Ubuntu, a very popular Linux distro, comes with a different graphical window system than Fedora.
