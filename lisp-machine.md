A Lisp Machine is a Lisp-based computer that was popular in the earlier days of computing. They fell out of favor once [[C]] came onto the scene.

Typically the operating system, from top to bottom, except for maybe some hardware-level code, is written in the same programming language. Lisp Machines were tightly coupled to their hardware, as their hardware was optimized for running Lisp.

Some have said that [[Emacs]] may count as a modern example of a Lisp Machine.
