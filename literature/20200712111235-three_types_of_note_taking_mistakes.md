# Three types of note-taking mistakes



<a id="org6da8114"></a>

## Notes

1.  Keep all notes in one place. This is bad because it requires &ldquo;categorization&rdquo; and makes things difficult to find
2.  Collect notes related only to specific projects. Again, requires categorization (all new information must pertain to that project specifically) and you must start from scratch with every new project
3.  Treat all notes as fleeting notes. This will lead to chaos.
