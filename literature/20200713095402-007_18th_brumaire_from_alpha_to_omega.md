## Notes

-   Derek made the point that part of the power of [[social democrats]] comes from the streets, part from the government, but they never sum to be a singular power, and the government power tends to turn against the street power
-   Derek said that confining yourself organizing [[nation states]] will result in either social democracy and [[nationalism]]. Communist political work must be international
-   Derek said that [[Stalinists]] are [[rightists]] who you self-respecting leftists should not be in coalition with
-   Derek said that if you don&rsquo;t move beyond the nation state form, you&rsquo;ll end up having the revolution subsumed and the revolutionaries replace the ruling class in some manner or another, leaving a half-finished revolution
