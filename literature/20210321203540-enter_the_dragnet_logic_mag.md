## Notes

-   Palantir is building a system by which any law enforcement agency can look up records for people
-   Palantir&rsquo;s system collects astronomical amounts of law enforcement data
-   Users can use Palantir&rsquo;s systems to drill down to find people matching particular descriptions
-   All of the features of [[big data]] are being used on criminal and law enforcement data in Palantir&rsquo;s systems
-   Systems are either query-based or alert-based
-   Automated license plate readers collect and store information on everyone, not just those under investigation
-   Palantir&rsquo;s system allows for circumstantial evidence to paint a more comprehensive picture than what&rsquo;s really going on
