## Notes

-   [[Samir Amin]] characterized the current era of capitalism as the era of &ldquo;generalized monopolies&rdquo;
-   The development of technology goes hand in hand with the development of the increase of relative surplus value, as outlined in [[Capital Vol. 1]], as well as productive forces in general
-   &ldquo;a collective and social intelligence created by accumulated knowledge and techniques&rdquo;
