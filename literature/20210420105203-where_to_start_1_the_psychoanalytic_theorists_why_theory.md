## Notes

The episode claims that [[Sigmund Freud]]&rsquo;s most important work is _Beyond the Pleasure Principle_, but that you shouldn&rsquo;t start reading Freud with that.

Jacqueline Rose has important commentary on Freud&rsquo;s later works.

[[Sigmund Freud]] essentially believed that [[one is not born a woman]].

[[Jacques Lacan]] didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;become Lacan&rdquo; until Seminar XI.

> Hegel&rsquo;s idea of the subject is only free when it recognizes itself in absolute otherness.

Lacan&rsquo;s idea of anxiety is a bit like Hegel&rsquo;s idea of freedom.

The hosts do not like Lacan&rsquo;s _Ecrits_ much.

[[Zizek]] believes that [[Christianity]] has an atheistic core to it.

[[Sigmund Freud]]&rsquo;s point regarding the phallus is that it&rsquo;s false from the start, it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;phallo-centric&rdquo;. [[Psychoanalysis]] is an analysis of a phallo-centric society.
