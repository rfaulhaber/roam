## Notes

The author disagrees with the assertion that [[Engels]] is responsible for reducing [[Marxism]] to a positivist epistemology and reductionist ontology.

The author asserts that due to the contents of [[Dialectics of Nature]] make [[Engels]] the first [[ecological]] thinker.

In the [[Soviet Union]], [[Engels]] was used as a means of maintaining Soviet orthodoxy. Quantum mechanics research was very likely stifled in the USRR for this reason.
