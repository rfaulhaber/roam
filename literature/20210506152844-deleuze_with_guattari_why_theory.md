## Notes

[[Anti-Oedipus]] is &ldquo;Capitalism and Schizophrenia Vol. 1&rdquo; while [[A Thousand Plateus]] is Vol. 2.

The context for [[Anti-Oedipus]] is that, with [[May 1968]] in the background, the credibility of [[psychoanalysis]] had been undermined in France (the psychoanalysts who observed it believed that the leftists participating merely wanted more repression). The goal was to rid psychoanalysis of the Oedipal structure, as well as do away with psychoanalysis itself.

The basis of the critique is opposition to the [[Oedipal structure]] as defining _all_ [[desire]].

Calling [[psychoanalysis]] &ldquo;the handmaiden of [[capital]]&rdquo; is a bit of an overstatement, as [[Freud]] spent much of his life simply trying to get by.

For [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]], [[desire]] appears to be tied to the question of production, though the hosts believe that this is a bad reading. The hosts believe that desire is entirely about lack.

[[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] popularized the idea of the [[rhizome]], the idea that thought moves in a non-hierarchical manner and in many different directions. The hosts argue that this was an anticipation of the next development of capitalism, i.e. [[neoliberalism]].

What&rsquo;s unique about [[fascism]] is that it allows for both transgression and the ability to follow authoritatively.

> Orwell misunderstood that the problem in _1984_ is not Big Brother but Little Brother.
