## Notes

The hosts believe that the primary driving force of [[psychoanalysis]] is [[drive theory]], which they believe [[Deleuze]] actively opposes.

[[Descartes]] started the trend that [[philosophy]] and [[science]] should be about avoiding error, though [[Deleuze]] believed the problem was banality. (?) Deleuze thought that this manner of thinking limited freedom, e.g. put boundaries on what could be thought. Even though the [[theory of relativity]] may be literally correct, proposing ideas that contradicted it could be seen as a limitation on freedom[^fn:1].

[[Deleuze]] is working against [[Hegel]], who didn&rsquo;t necessarily believe in _error-free_ thinking.

[[Deleuze]] wants a &ldquo;beyond without contradiction.&rdquo;

[[Spinoza]] believed that God&rsquo;s prohibitions were prohibitions of things that are bad for us, so there&rsquo;s no evil, just bad.
