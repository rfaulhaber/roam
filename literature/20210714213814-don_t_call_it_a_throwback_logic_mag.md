## Notes

Something like 90% of all DNA sequenced is from Western Europeans.

Genetic sequencing is for the pursuit of drug production.

Companies like 23andMe sell genetic data to drug manufactuerers the same way Google sells user data to advertisers.

> Vertex Pharmaceuticals, for example, used genetic sequence data derived from cystic fibrosis patients, which they got from the nonprofit Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Vertex incorporated and recruited patients through that avenue, sequenced their genomes, and then refined the development of this new drugâ€”and then sold it back to those exact same people for $300,000 dollars a year.

The hot thing in the industry now is using AI to try and predict things like cancerous mutations, but this is worthless if it&rsquo;so only trained on the DNA of white people.
