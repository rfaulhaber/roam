I&rsquo;ve tried to omit notes on Harvey summarizing Marx. That should be left to the [[Capital Vol. 1]] notes.


## Chapter 11: The Secret of Primitive Accumulation

-   Primitive accumulation is about the origins of wage labor
-   Competition always tends to produce centralization
-   The power of Marx&rsquo;s argument is that he, essentially, buried the classical political economists with their own words
-   note to self: if there is any use in the term [[neoliberalism]] it&rsquo;s that it describes an economic period of stopping the declining rate of profit. This tendency is only an acceleration of the tendencies we see in _Capital_
-   the ideological aspects of liberalism; the freedom, individualism, the &ldquo;market for the benefit of all&rdquo; stuff is all shown to be hollow in Marx
    -   ironically, it&rsquo;s shown to be hollow because he shows that capitalism wasn&rsquo;t born out of some fair and equal world, but of enslavement, theft, violence, etc.
-   the central question of part 8 is how labor became a commodity (at least in England)
-   Harvey recommends &ldquo;The Invention of Capitalism&rdquo;


### Primitive Accumulation

-   The release of the retainers allowed for money power to begin to be exercised
    -   Harvey says that in the _Grundrisse_ that Marx says that money dissolved the traditional community in favor of one in which **money** becomes the community (i.e. a market?)
-   The accumulation of money power is curbed by the usage of money in this manner, for two reasons (the following are quotes):
    1.  The state depends on and thereby becomes vulnerable to money power
    2.  Money power can be created an mobilized in ways that state legislation has difficulty stopping
-   The rise of the different capitalists allows them to bend the state to their collective will
-   Harvey remarks that capitalism developed on &ldquo;greenfield sites.&rdquo; Is this where the term comes from?
-   &ldquo;Greenfield sites&rdquo; are areas where capitalism was able to develop away from guilds, laws, local merchants, i.e. anyone who _could_ stop you.
    -   Could [[colonialism]] have been a large-scale &ldquo;greenfield site&rdquo; operation?
-   Harvey kind of insinuates that the book should have ended at 32, and that 32 ends with a revolutionary call to action that is deflated by chapter 33
-   Hegel theorized that societies are driven to colonialization as a way to return to the pastoral life of peasantry


### Commentary

-   Modern scholarship, according to Harvey, shows that Marx&rsquo;s account of primitive accumulation is a bit exaggerated, though not entirely wrong
    -   For example, there are instances where peasants weren&rsquo;t forced off the land so much as they were goaded peacefully
    -   Despite this, Marx&rsquo;s analysis is significant and groundbreaking for its time
-   Harvey brings up that [[Rosa Luxemburg]] believes it wrong that there are two separate forms of exploitation: the commodity market and the relations between capitalism and the non-capitalist modes of production
    -   Harvey says that she believes that primitive accumulation wasn&rsquo;t merely capitalism&rsquo;s original sin: it is also its ongoing sin. Capitalism would have long ago been extinguished had it not constantly found fresh rounds of primitive accumulation
    -   One such way being [[imperialism]]
    -   Harvey also suggests (that Luxemburg would probably suggest) that [[China]]&rsquo;s own opening up and agricultural revolution have been yet another instance of primitive accumulation
    -   The invention of personal finance could also be seen as a form of primitive accumulation
        -   I don&rsquo;t know if I agree with this, but credit does open up fresh avenues of capital extraction
-   Harvey argues that neoliberalism is a sort of primitive accumulation, though I would probably not agree with him on that
