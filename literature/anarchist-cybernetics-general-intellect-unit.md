Notes for all three parts of this series will be listed here.


## Notes

-   [[Occupy]] didn&rsquo;t provide a convincing anti-statist alternative as far as the right was concerned in the United States. It&rsquo;s not right to say that Occupy directly bolstered the right, but it didn&rsquo;t convince them either, and instead they got the libertarian movement of the early 2010s
-   Occupy was a movement that involved a lot of the developments of [[anarchism]] in the 90s and was openly hostile to the [[Democratic Party]]
-   Occupy and the [[Arab Spring]] were global revolutionary movements similar to the [[Revolutions of 1848]]
-   The mentality that came out of Occupy was a kind of [[anarcho-liberalism]]
-   Political parties were not codified into what we think of now until the 20th century. Prior to that they were mostly just a loose association of people
-   [[Propaganda of the deed]] is not [[prefigurative politics]], it is a transitional program
-
