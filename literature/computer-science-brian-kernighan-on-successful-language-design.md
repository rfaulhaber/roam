## Notes

-   [[Brian Kernighan]] believes that what makes languages successful is their ability to essentially describe the problem set
-   [[awk]] is better for finding a sum or average of tabular data than, say, [[C]]
-   [[DSL]]s seem to have more novelty than general purpose programming languages, and some interesting innovations, because they describe a particular problem set
-   Writing a DSL is probably more worth your time than trying to write the next huge [[general-purpose language]]
