## Notes

In the split between the [[Young Hegelians]] and the [[Right Hegelians]], each misunderstands contradiction as the [[dialectic]].

The right wing of this thought wants to seek an end, or a synthesis, while the left realizes (or should realize) that contradiction is eternal.

Synthesis is meeting in the middle.

The contradiction is unsolvable.

[[Consciousness]] is geared towards solution, while [[unconsciousness]] is geared towards un-solution.

[[Freud]] believed that we are subject of and to the [[unconsciousness]], and that for [[Hegel]], contradiction meant a constant struggle against ourselves.

[[Right wing]] political thought is, as the hosts believe, an attempt to eliminate contradiction, while [[left wing]] thought is the embrace of the contradiction.

[[Self-betrayal]] are those moments when you say something but perhaps meant something else. At the level of what you said you&rsquo;re betraying how you really feel, or so it seems to another.

[[Hegel]]&rsquo;s belief was very strongly tied up with [[Christianity]], and the mistake that Hegel&rsquo;s [[left wing]] inheritors make, the hosts claim, is separating that.

[[Hegel]] believes that when [[Christ]] [[died on the cross]], that mankind had not killed a [[representation of God]], but had killed God himself (sounds like [[Nietzsche]]&rsquo;s [[death of God]] a little).

The 20th century is about a leftist anti-Hegelianism, such as [[Foucault]], [[Adorno]], [[Deleuze]], etc.
