## Notes

Helen Yaffe says that [[Cuba]] is a [[democracy]], though one unlike those found throughout the world. Their vision of government was one that was inspired by their past prior to the [[Cuban Revolution]].

After the [[Cuban Revolution]], representative organizations were set up immediately. These organizations offer various levels of representation spanning from the local level to the national level.

Some principles on Cuban democracy:

-   The communist party does not stand in elections
-   Cuban political system is always in flux, trying to improve itself
-   

Levels of Cuban government:

-   Municipalities, which elect representatives which are rotated frequently
-   Municipal assembly
    -   Can&rsquo;t nominate yourself, must be nominated by someone else
    -   Must specify what you&rsquo;ve done for the community
    -   Once you&rsquo;ve won, you&rsquo;re not paid
        -   Stay part of the community
    -   Every 6 months you must report results
        -   Electorate may recall you
-   Provincial assembly
    -   Elected from municipal assembly
-   National assembly
    -   Elected from provincial assembly
    -   Half come up through above process
    -   Even [[Fidel Castro]] was elected in this manner
    -   Other half come from organizations of the masses, such as students&rsquo;s federation, trade unionists, etc.
-   Council of State
    -   Elected from national assembly
    -   Elects people to run country

In 1970s Cuba had chose to take a socialist route, and [[Fidel Castro]] had originally not wanted to. &ldquo;He lost the argument.&rdquo;

[[Cuba]] is a [[representative democracy]], though not like the [[United States]].

Council of State is consensus-based.

An important part of Cuban government is government public consultation, where the government is extremely concerned about what the people think and takes people&rsquo;s ideas into consideration and receive feedback.

> I don&rsquo;t think many Americans think that they elect their president.
