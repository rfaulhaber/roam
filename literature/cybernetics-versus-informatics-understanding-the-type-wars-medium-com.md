## Notes

-   The two competing visions that emerged in the early days of programming came from mathematics ([[Lisp]]) and engineering (Fortran)
-   systems that consume data, manipulate it in terms of semantic meaning, and produce meaningful results
-   systems that satisfy requirements meaningfully and adaptively in novel and uncertain environments
-   Lisp was born out of an environment that sought to understand computing as solving symbolic expressions (like you do in math)
-   Usage of Lisp declined as interest in classical AI (symbolic AI) declined, as Lisp was thought of being the language of AI
    -   Symbolic AI stressed a neo-[[Cartesian]] model of computing, by which sensory input was processed through &ldquo;brain modules&rdquo;
-   As Lisp faded into the background, another mathematical concept began coming to the foreground: static type checking and &ldquo;programs-as-proofs&rdquo;
-   [[Clojure]] was a huge innovation in the Lisp world, bringing immutability and laziness, among other things
    -   Clojure seeks to maximize expressivity over formal verification, although formal verification is a goal as of 2016
-   Languages like [[Haskell]] and [[Standard ML]] use their type systems to allow for formal verification
-   If a dog wanted to reach something across a barrier, in the real world it would use its accumulated experience, exploitation of the environment, and experimentation to find a solution.
    -   The informatics approach to solving this problem would be to model the world
    -   the cybernetic approach would be to create adaptive systems that are capable of adapting to such a thing
