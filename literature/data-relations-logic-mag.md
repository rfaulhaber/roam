## Notes

The so-called &ldquo;data economy&rdquo; is driven on the collection of data. One&rsquo;s credit card transaction is recorded, noting what they bought, where, how much they paid for it, etc. and then sold.

Critiques of &ldquo;datafiction&rdquo; are related to [[Foucault]]&rsquo;s idea of the [[panopticon]]: a kind of prison where prisoners self-regulated their behavior because they knew they were being watched.

As data becomes commodified it becomes the &ldquo;material process by which injustice happens.&rdquo;
