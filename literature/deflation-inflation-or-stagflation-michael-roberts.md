## Notes

-   With the possibility of the COVID-19 pandemic coming to a close, there&rsquo;s a concern among first world economists of &ldquo;overheating&rdquo; the economy
-   There are also concerns of increasing inflation, matched with so-called &ldquo;pent-up demand&rdquo;
-   Roberts believes that talks of inflation are overblown, that the real question is whether or not &ldquo;full-employment&rdquo; will be able to return in the short-term
