## Notes

[[Deleuze]] wrote about [[cinema]] later in his career.

> The break in cinema is not between the silent movie and the talkie, it&rsquo;s between the movement-image and the time-image. &#x2014; Deleuze, as quoted by the hosts

Throughout the history of film, early [[film theorists]] such as [[Sergei Eisenstein]] believed that film could be used to convey ideas of the mind, etc. in a broad sense. Today, people have an idea of film that each film is supposed to say something through its narrative.

[[Deleuze]] seems to believe that [[cinema]] says things that [[philosophy]] hasn&rsquo;t caught up with, and he is attempting to thereby catch up with cinema.

movement-image
: image that depicts something that goes against our expectations. Think [[Charlie Chaplin]].

Aside: [[Sergei Eisenstein]] made the connection between Griffiths and his racism and the form in which he made movies.

Most of this episode deals with film.
