## Notes

-   Ecology is the study of natural relationships
-   Ecology forces a shift in perspective from objects to relationships and processes
-   [[Systems thinkers]] realized that laws of science were not enough, but we don&rsquo;t need anything from the outside: we have to understand the relationships of matter
-   Capra says that there are two approaches to science: &ldquo;What is it made of?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What is the pattern?&rdquo;
-   A pattern isn&rsquo;t material, it&rsquo;s a set of relationships
    -   Marx would probably disagree with this
-   Capra believes that consciousness is a property of life
-   An insight of [[cybernetics]] was noticing that life is made up of networks
-   Systems can correct themselves through the process of [[feedback]]
