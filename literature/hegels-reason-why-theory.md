## Notes

[[Hegel]]&rsquo;s [[reason]] is counterintuitive: he wants to put [[contradiction]] back into [[reason]], and he wants to do so contra [[Kant]].

> Reason looks out at the world and the world is its world. &#x2014; [[Hegel]]

[[Hegel]] believes that [[reason]] is contingent on the self, not the opposite as many believe: that reason is not objective.

[[Hegel]] says that [[Kant]]&rsquo;s 12 categories are &ldquo;a disgrace to science&rdquo;, and felt that there was just a single category, called &ldquo;the category&rdquo;. &ldquo;The category&rdquo; allows for the connection between subject and reason. &ldquo;The category&rdquo; for Hegel is the subject and the object together (a bit like the [[split subject]] in [[Lacanian]] [[psychoanalysis]]).

> Every scientific experiment is searching for the truth of subjectivity, because that&rsquo;s what reason does. &#x2014; Todd McGowan

[[Hegel]]&rsquo;s entire idea about reason is similar to the [[observer effect]]: that _you_ make a difference upon the world simply by observing it. He believes that we perform experiments with the purpose of stripping away our sensability from our insight, with the hope of arriving at a universal law, and that that&rsquo;s his critique of induction.
