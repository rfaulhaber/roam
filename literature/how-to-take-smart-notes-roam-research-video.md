Literature notes should be brief, atomic, and not contain quotes

The video also illustrates that literature notes should contain page numbers, like so:
    
    ```org
    ​    - p. 19
    ​      - some note that occurs on page 19
    ```
    
    -   This may be difficult if reading from an e-reader, where pages are relative!

if taking notes on an e-reader, review your highlights or in-app notes and translate them into roam notes later

permanent notes should come _directly_ from literature notes
    -   in the video he highlights &ldquo;journaling is the easiest way of getting feedback&rdquo; and turns it into a note unto itself

tags and keywords should be framed as &ldquo;how do I want to find / use this information?&rdquo;

permanent notes should be fully formed

permanent notes should also contain keywords, references, etc.
