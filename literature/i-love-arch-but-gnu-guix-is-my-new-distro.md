## Notes

[[Guix]] is a [[Linux distro]] and package manager distributed by the [[GNU]] project. It is similar to [[NixOS]].

Unlike NixOS, which is customized with [[Nix]], Guix is customized with [[Guile]], a [[Scheme]].

Much like Nix, Guix uses [[symlinks]] to build unique user profiles. Like Nix, Guix programs are installed in isolation from one another.

Proported benefits of Guix:

-   Development environments
-   Reproducible
