## Notes

-   Lower-to-middle management was able to be organized as they were closer to workers than CEOs
-   Union proposed a media blackout
    -   Going to media is a way to use leverage
    -   Don&rsquo;t want to shoot your shot
-   Management was punitive, emotionally manipulated organizers
-   Management reaction is similar to other organizing efforts
-   Organizing should be joyous, otherwise organizers will burn themselves out
-   Organizing should be personal
-   Kickstarter organizers knew they were going to set a precedent
-   Managers and business owners are able to organize on company time, unlike workers, example of how the bourgeoisie uses worker power against itself
-   Managers etc. can leverage business resources as well as the state against workers
