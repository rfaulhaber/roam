## Notes

The meat industry is incredibly hazardous: it is dangerous for the workers, it kills an unfathomable amount of animals (150 chickens per minute!), uses a tremendous amount of land, [[breeds pandemics]], and it&rsquo;s only getting worse!

Lab grown meat may alleviate some of these problems, but could possibly lead to weird IP laws and all the other horrible Silicon Valley-type thinking
