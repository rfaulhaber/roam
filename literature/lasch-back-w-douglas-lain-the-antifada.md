## Notes

-   Woke / anti-woke dichotomy is false and mutually consistent
-   The idea that capitalism can work out its own crises is disproven most recently by the [[COVID Crash]]
-   Doug mentioned that he &ldquo;likes&rdquo; Elon Musk because he offers a vision of the future, something leftists generally do not do
