## Notes

-   Colin: a fundamental point of MMT is the question of [[imperialism]]
-   Varn: Fred Mosley was the closest he got to understanding [[commodity money]]
-   Varn: MMT has issues when it comes to [[currency sovereignty]]
    -   It only works in countries with it
-   Varn: [[there&rsquo;s no such thing as barter]]
-   Colin: Capital Vol. 3 is not a solution to Marx&rsquo;s money problem
-   Colin: Marx assumes that the market is an externality, money does not have a price. Money itself is not something that is bought and sold, therefore we get &ldquo;for free&rdquo;
-   Colin: Market is an exchange of equivalents
-   Colin: Marx believes the ultimate question to answer is to explain [[M-C-M&rsquo;]]
-   Colin: The market as a system of equalities is the problem with Marx
-   Colin: what makes the market is the bid/ask spread
    -   Marx assumes this away
-   Varn: a problem with Marx is that Marxists cannot find where valorization occurs
-   See: _Stone Age Economy_
-   Varn: Banaji said that [[capitalism could have started in the Roman Empire]]
-   Varn: Marx gets a lot of ideas about economy from Aristotle
-   Colin: capitalism is much more nebulous than Marxists put it
-   Black Death in England had an interesting economic situation
    -   All subjects were part of the money economy
    -   Pretty historically unique
-   Colin: Marx&rsquo;s baggage is Aristotle&rsquo;s baggage
-   Colin: Capitalization is what capitalism is about, i.e., turning things into money
-   Capitalism makes having a horde of money no longer necessary because money can be valorized / capitalized
-   _The Code of Capital_
-   England in late 14th century needed cash in the economy, needed &ldquo;pennies to do more work&rdquo;
-   Colin: why did the English off-shore their metabolic base? via colonialization
-   Colin: Marx lived in a period of time where prices were basically flat for 100 years, which is why Marx thought what he did about prices
-   Colin: what if capitalism is a temporary period?
-   Colin: Chartalism and metalism are two parts of the same system
-   Varn: the USSR had three types of rubles, wanted to be autarchic
-   Varn: [[it&rsquo;s wrong to assume that law is class neutral]]
    -   Law starts as religious and becomes political
-   Colin: it&rsquo;s western common sense that a sovereign is not above the law
-   Colin: as soon as you invent a &ldquo;unit of account&rdquo;, loans can grow out of proportion to the real economy
-   Colin: most loans are not the lending of physical coins
-   Colin: writing was invented to keep track of debts
-   Colin: Europe sold slaves to Asia
-   Colin: Christianity is the religion where debt abolition is a central concept but can only be escaped at the end of the world
-   Varn: the reason why taxes in the early Americas were tarriffs etc. was because you couldn&rsquo;t find everyone you needed to tax
    -   And also probably because wage labor didn&rsquo;t exist
-   Colin: English king was incredibly constrained to raise revenue. Peasants revolted when individually taxed
-   Colin: we only have paper money because it doesn&rsquo;t matter what kind of money we have
-   Colin: Marxists are wrong in that state activity monetize economies
-   Varn: first people to draw salaries historically were soldiers
-   Colin: term &ldquo;soldier&rdquo; means someone who&rsquo;s paid with &ldquo;solius&rdquo; (?) i.e. gold coin
-   Colin: money is a class conflict phenomenon
-   Colin: people assume that austerity exists because politicians don&rsquo;t know how money works
-   Varn: implementing MMT would require a lot of conflict
-   Colin: the English monetary system became the global monetary system
-   Varn: taxation only exists to limit inflation
-   Varn: skeptical MMT is possible in a democracy
-   Colin: All GDP growth since the 70s is an accounting gimmick


## Takeaways

This was a very winding conversation with a lot of rabbit holes. Some important points were:

-   Money is a tool of class conflict
-   The market is not necessarily a system of equivalent exchange
-   If capitalism is nothing else, it&rsquo;s the system under which money is valorized
-   MMT may be more on track than Marxism but implementing MMT in a liberal democracy would be a waste of time
