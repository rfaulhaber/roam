## Notes

-   Check out &ldquo;From the Web of Life&rdquo;
-   Foster wants to tease out the ecology in Marx&rsquo;s writings
-   Marx was probably not a [[developmentalist]]
-   Ecological theory is articulated through [[materialism]]
-   Marx criticizes [[Proudhon]] for being Promethean. Marx saw [[Prometheus]] as a revolutionary
-   Marx was opposed to [[teleological]] technological progression
    -   That is to say that Marx didn&rsquo;t think that technological progress had an end goal, it just happened
    -   And that it happened according to social processes, i.e. that it is a process that&rsquo;s happening
-   Technological development is subordinate to social processes (this is mentioned in [[Capital Vol. 1]])
-   Marx was heavily inspired by [[Epicurus]]
-   [[Feuerbach]] was a Hegelian but broke with [[Hegel]] and became a materialist
-   Feuerbach&rsquo;s materialism came from exploring the relationships between human beings
    -   Feuerbach felt that man became alienated from his own ideas (hence his ideas on religion). Marx broke with Feuerbach due to alienation of labor
-   Epicurus was seen as the materialist antidote to [[idealism]] and [[religion]]
    -   Epicurus&rsquo;s philosophy believed that gods only existed in the spaces between atoms
-   [[Malthus]] thought that human population and food production didn&rsquo;t increase at the same rate, i.e. that human population growth could outpace food production
    -   In his own time this was not well received
    -   Marx harshly criticizes Malthus
-   Malthus thinks that overpopulation is always happening. Class society is what keeps population in check, thought that reproduction of nature was a steady state, or constant
    -   This was a response to the [[French Revolution]], which sought to create a model society and undo class society (to some degree)
-   [[Darwin]]&rsquo;s [[theory of evolution]] had more to do with [[co-operation]] than with &ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo;
-   [[Engels]] theorized that intelligence presupposes labor, not the other way around
    -   Engels has been vindicated by modern science
-   [[Class struggle]] can be seen as a sort of social [[natural selection]]
-   [[The Long Twentieth Century]] talks about the metabolism of society, much like this work does
-   [[Metabolic rift]] describes the distance between man and nature. Society is a metabolism and outgrowth of nature, yet there&rsquo;s a distinction between them
