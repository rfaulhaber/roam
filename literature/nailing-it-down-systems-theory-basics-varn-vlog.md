# Nailing It Down: Systems Theory Basics | Varn Vlog



## Notes

-   [[efficiency]] is work / energy input
-   [[systems]] are brittle when they take on too much stress and break
-   brittleness is related to cascade failure
-   [[centralization]] doesn&rsquo;t lead to efficiency necessarily. centralization requires more energy input
-   [[Deleuze]] and Guattari believed that capitalism was [[rhizomatic]] (like grass, nodes in the system were expendable because the whole system was so diffuse)
-   [[Deleuze]] did not account for agency in the system
-   we don&rsquo;t evolve for efficiency, we evolve for survival
-   debates over centralization have to take into account this energy efficiency
