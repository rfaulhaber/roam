## Notes

-   With the refutation of the [[tragedy of the commons]] came three ideas about what [[the commons]] are:
    1.  Common goods - resources required to survive and thrive. Everything from food to art to nature itself.
    2.  Commoners - groups of people who share these resources
    3.  Commoning - inclusive, participatory and transparent forms of decision making and rules governing access to common resources
