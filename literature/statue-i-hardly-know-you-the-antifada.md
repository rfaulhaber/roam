Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t manage to take enough notes while listening to this episode, but these are the highlights from what I remember:


## Notes

-   [[Abraham Lincolon]] oversaw one of the largest land-grabs of Native American lands in US history
-   Civil War veterans waged war with Native peoples at previously unprecedented rates
-   The [[Civil War]] was only won because, as [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] said, slaves in the south essentially went on strike
-   Native Americans, like any other people under [[capitalism]], have a possibility of being subsumed into the capitalist system
    -   There are Native peoples who have turned to extractive resources as a means of using it as a cudgel against their oppressors. They are often forced into resource extraction and they never see the wealth of their labor
        -   Consider Bolivia and their lithium extraction
    -   Native Americans who turn to coal extraction sometimes don&rsquo;t even have power for their communities
-   Nick says that Native American populations have high amounts of class consciousness due to the oppression they&rsquo;ve faced
-   Nick says that, whatever form decolonization takes, it cannot involve the [[Westphalia model of nation states]]
    -   He also believes it must involve moving beyond capitalism
