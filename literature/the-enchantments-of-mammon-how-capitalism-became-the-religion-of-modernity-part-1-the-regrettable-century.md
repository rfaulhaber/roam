## Notes

-   Prior to capitalism there was an understood enchantment of the world, somewhat popularized by the [[Catholic Church]]. After [[Protestantism]] entered the scene, this enchantment was replaced with rationality
-   Protestantism sees the rituals of Catholicism paganistic
-   [[Weber]] said that protestantism was a mistrust of ritual and sacraments in religion
-   Protestantism is the spirit that drives America and capitalism
-   Weber said that protestants saw success in business as religious success
-   He said that attempts to re enchant the world will only be a kind of self therapy, consolation, to make
-   Sacraments pervaded every aspect of life in the [[medieval period]]
-   [[The commons]] were granted collective ownership of a certain portion of land. This idea flies in the face of modern capitalism
-   Land was constantly equitably divided in [[the commons]], frequently redistributed according to common need
-   Although the commons sound great, the past shouldn&rsquo;t be romanticized. Medieval Christendom was as hypocritical as modern [[capitalist ideology]]
-   Catholicism (notably Thomas Aquinas and St. Francis of Assisi) considered communism the ideal, [[private property]] a necessary concession
-   Catholic monastic orders were essentially communist: believed in common ownership, common work, etc.
-   Peasants revolts in this period occurred because nobles didn&rsquo;t adequately protect peasantry. A sort of social contract was violated
-   Protestants re-invented their own rituals. May speak to a desire of belonging and purpose
-   Much of the [[Inquisition]] wasn&rsquo;t as bad as people thought; their aim was to combat [[heresy]], to kill someone would have been seen as a failure.
-   The [[Spanish Inquisition]] _was_ as bad as people thought; it was a [[colonialist]] project to reclaim land and integrate population
-   Accumulation of wealth was seen as a Protestant duty to God ([[prosperity theology]])
-   [[John Locke]] said that land had to be improved, nature has no value, and otherwise you don&rsquo;t have a right to it
-   [[Milton]] suggested that having to labor was the punishment imposed by God, self-reliance is satanic
-   The [[Diggers]] were an anti-capitalist movement of sorts, who aimed to undo [[enclosure]]
    -   [[Gerrard Winstanley]] wrote something like &ldquo;Why is knowledge only ever used for misery and not for the enrichment of all?&rdquo;
-   [[Marx]] says the antidote to religion is [[revolution]]. The essence of Christianity (i.e. communistic living) is the essence of humanity
    -   Religion is a necessary medicine for a world of pain, [[&ldquo;opiate of the masses&rdquo;]]
-   Marxists should be against mechanized reason, not reason itself
