## Notes

[[Magnus Hirschfeld]] opened the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]], after being visited by a gay and trans soldier who later killed himself on the eve of his wedding.

The institute provided:

-   Sex education and health clinics
-   Advice on contraception
-   Research on [[gender]] and [[sexuality]]

> Love is as varied as people are. &#x2014; [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]

[The famous image of the Nazi book burnings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_book_burnings#/media/File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG) depicts [[Nazis]] burning the books of the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]].
