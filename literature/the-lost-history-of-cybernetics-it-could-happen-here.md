# The Lost History of Cybernetics | It Could Happen Here

Interview on [[cybernetics]] with [[General Intellect Unit]].


## Notes

-   [[Hegel]] was a precursor to cybernetic thought, where he understood being not only as substance but as subject, where he understood the whole system as a holistic entity rather than an individual interacting with an external environment
-   The precursors to [[ecology]] can be seen as precursors to [[cybernetics]], since ecologists sought to understand the organism _in_ its environment
