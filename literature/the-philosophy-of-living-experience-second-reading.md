# The Philosophy of Living Experience (second reading)



## Introduction

[[Bogdanov]] is trying to deal with individual thought and reconcile that with social thought.

Bogdanov wants to remove the technical jargon barring uneducated people from accessing philosophy.

Bogdanov says that truth is relative but it doesn&rsquo;t prevent us from saying useful things that speak to the truth of the world. Truth is a particular tool of human activity.

Bogdanov believes that most people have their own philosophy that is based on fragments of collective experience.

> The goal of philosophy is to unify the experience of all people of past and present generations into a rigorous and coherent system for understanding the world.


## 1. What is Materialism?

> [[Nature]] is what people call the endlessly unfolding field of their [[labor-experience]].

For Bogdanov, [[labor]] is the human activity that &ldquo;changes the correlation of certain elements in nature.&rdquo; That means that Bogdanov considers [[labor a special activity]]. He even says that &ldquo;labor organizes the world for humanity.&rdquo;

[[Democrtius]] believed that one&rsquo;s soul was literally material.
