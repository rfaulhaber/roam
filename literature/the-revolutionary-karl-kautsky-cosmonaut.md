## Notes

-   [[Vladimir Lenin]] was the first and most influential person to malign Kautsky
-   [[Stalin]]&rsquo;s short course also minimized the role of Kautsky
-   Throughout the early socialist movement there was a strong emphasis on [[republicanism]], and Kautsky also wrote about this
    -   Perhaps this was because many early socialist countries were also effectively autocracies, and republicanism was relatively radical compared to that
-   [[Engels]] said that the [[French Third Republic]] was &ldquo;an empire without an empire&rdquo;
-   Kautsky felt that [[direct democracy]] was of only limited use, and criticized other socialists over it
-   Probably not useful to think of the [[SPD]] as just a [[labor party]], but as a Marxist party that degenerated
