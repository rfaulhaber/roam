# Three Types of Notes



## Notes

These were mentioned earlier, but deserve some more elaboration.

Fleeting notes
: Temporary reminders of information

Permanent notes
: Contain necessary information in a _permanently understandable way_. These should be so well-developed that they could be inserted into a publication.

Project notes
: Notes which are relevant only to a specific project. Kept in a project-specific place
    -   In org-roam&rsquo;s case, perhaps a (writing) project could contain it&rsquo;s own roam note.
    -   Project notes can be:
        -   comments in the manuscript
        -   collections of project-related literature
        -   outlines
        -   snippets of drafts
        -   reminders
        -   to-do lists
        -   publication drafts
