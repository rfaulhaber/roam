[[Autonomist]] proposal for alternative means of organizing.


## Notes

The author is seeking to find an alternative to the Marxist political parties of old and syndicalist unions.

The author believes that Alcoholics Anonymous allows for a potential model for viable organizing among revolutionaries: AA is decentralized yet has millions of instances throughout the world, it allows for individuals to move beyond their simple _selves_ to change.

The author claims that [[cybernetics]] is the dominant [[episteme]] of the 21st century.

From the perspective of the governing, cybernetics aims to render populations into governable objects.

The author argues that cybernetic thought permeates the thought of [[Silicon Valley]].

The author argues that revolutionaries have also been thinking cybernetically, such as during the [[2019 Hong Kong protests]].

> &#x2026;the revolutionary process itself must contain the power to depose Empire, while healing our souls.

The author criticizes the left milieu of being unable to effectively organize, and thereby creating harmful and counterproductive organizations.

[[Vital cells]] are characterized by:

-   distributed network of cells
-   composed of interchangeable individuals
-   animated by common principles in response to concrete problems
-   made up of a network that is easily reproducible
-   integrates [[feedback]] mechanisms to guide group development

Extrinsic relations refer to the autonomy of individuals in relation to cells.
