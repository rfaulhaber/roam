## Notes

Society in the [[Roman Empire]] had a kind of theory about [[race]]: they believed certain people from certain areas had certain characteristics.

In spite of that, the [[Roman Empire]] was a wildly diverse place: the empire imported things from outside the empire (such as pears) and things like wine were ubiquitous but not your only option.

[[Roman culture]] itself was derived from [[Ancient Greek]] culture, first imported from the Greek colonists in the south of the Italian peninsula.

In conquering Europe, Rome caused the histories of many of the people it conquered lost, integrating them into the empire.

Rome may not have had a concept of [[race]] or [[ethnicity]] like we do today, though it&rsquo;s clear that there was some concept of ethnicity as the Romans would discriminate based on it.
