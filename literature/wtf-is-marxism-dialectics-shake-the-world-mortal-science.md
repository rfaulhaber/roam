-   Derrick says that the thing that unties Marxists historically is the [[labor theory of value]]
-   Ezri says that if you hold that [[socialism]] is just a form of managed capitalism, then you must think of [[exploitation]] in a different way than [[Marx]] did
-   Ezri says that [[dialectical materialism]] is, broadly, a [[philosophy of science]], not just social phenomena
-   [[Dialectics]] have been around since ancient Greek times as a means of argumentation, [[Hegel]]&rsquo;s innovation is that he turns it into an ontology
    -   Hegel&rsquo;s dialectics only works on ideas because for Hegel ideas are the only things that are real
-   What is unique to capitalism is reinvestment and wage labor i.e. labor as a market
-   The business cycle appears once you get industrial production
-   Derrick remarks that a lot of state activity is the battling between various factions of the bourgeoisie rather than class antagonisms
-   &ldquo;Communism is the removal of [[alienation]] from the productive realm&rdquo;
-   Classical dialectics is about creating definitions from a description or discussion so as to move to axiomatic logic
