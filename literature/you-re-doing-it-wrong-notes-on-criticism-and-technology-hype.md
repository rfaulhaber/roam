# Youâ€™re Doing It Wrong: Notes on Criticism and Technology Hype



## Notes

Although [[technology criticism]] is in vogue right now, the author feels that the pendulum is swinging too quickly in the other direction.

The problem isn&rsquo;t just tech enthusiasts, who make outlandish sci-fi claims: there are academics who are getting in on the discourse as well.

Most of the claims of new technology are simply hype to sell things. This hype also distracts from the very real world problems that tech causes.
