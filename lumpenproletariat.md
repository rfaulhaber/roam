# lumpenproletariat

The lumpenproletariat is a sub-strata of the [[proletariat]] who are not interested in [[class struggle]].

The term is somewhat problematic. It comes from [[Marx]] originally, and was used to describe those proletarians who do not contribute to the economy directly. Examples include: organized criminals, drug dealers (and anyone who participates in a black market) and sex workers.

The lumpenproletariat are seen as being counter-revolutionary. Their class interests are tied to something that&rsquo;s often actively hostile to the proletariat.

The term is often rejected by [[Marxists]] because it&rsquo;s thought of an instance of Marx just moralizing.

However, if there&rsquo;s any use of the term, it could be used to describe class enemies of the proletariat who themselves are proletariat. Organized crime and police could be such examples.
