# M-C-M exchange

: [[Capital]]


## Ideas


### From [[Capital Vol. 1]]

-   M-C-M is money-commodity-money
-   A capitalist converts money into commodities, and then turns those commodities back into money
-   Unlike [[C-M-C exchange]], the first and second Ms are not equivalent, so M-C-M can be called M-C-M&rsquo; (&ldquo;M prime&rdquo;)
-   M-C-M&rsquo; is [[the general formula of the circulation of capital]]
