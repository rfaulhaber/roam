In the aftermath of the [[Second World War]], as many as 55% of the federal government of West Germany had been former Nazis. Having been a member of the Nazi party was not seen as being such a bad thing in the first couple of decades after the war, and many former Nazis were able to simply continue their Nazi-related work out in the open.

Tangentially, the [[United States]] also sheltered many Nazis as part of [[Operation Paperclip]].
