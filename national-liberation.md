# national liberation

National liberation has been an important question for [[communists]] in the 20th century.

National liberation, broadly speaking, is the idea that a [[nation state]] is essentially a coherent group of people. Through this coherence there can be an independent nation.

Some nations oppress others through [[colonialism]]. Examples include:

-   [[Israel]] to [[Palestine]]
-   The [[United States]] to Native American and African American peoples
    -   See, the [[internal colony]] thesis as it pertains to black people
-   The English and French in Africa
