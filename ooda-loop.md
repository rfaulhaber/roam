# OODA loop

The OODA loop is a concept that was popularized by American military theorist [[John Boyd]]. The &ldquo;OODA&rdquo; acronym stands for:

-   Observe
-   Orient
-   Decide
-   Act

Boyd believed that this process was what made or broke tactical thinking in [[adversarial systems]]. He also believed that between two hostile agents, the victorious one would have a faster OODA loop than the other. In such a situation, one can gain an advantage over their opponent by interrupting their OODA loop.
