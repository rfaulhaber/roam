Per the argument given by Benanav in _Automation and the Future of Work_ the overcapacity in the manufacturing sector of the first world after WWII (particularly in the US) eventually caused the phenomenon known as deindustrialization. The US manufactured more goods than it could consume and exported them, creating the [[post-war era in the US]]. However, once other countries followed suit (beginning with Europe), the US could no longer compete with this global market, and the US manufacturing sector contracted, causing deindustrialization. Firms that could not keep up their productivity folded, and those that could became multinational.
