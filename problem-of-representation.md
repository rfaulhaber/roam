# problem of representation

: [[role of government]]

When it comes to the state, representation seems to be a persistent problem. In the [[United States]], the fact that many national and state-level politicians are white men is a persistent issue.

Also in the US, there is also the question of land representation. The [[Electoral College]] was set up to make it so that mostly agrarian economies were just as powerful in government as non-agrarian economies (and subsequently to maintain the institution of [[slavery]]).

Within the [[SPD]] there were kind of similar issues, where mostly industrial working class people were represented within the party. This minority faction was able to put forward the [[peasant question]] to the national party.

These issues bring up some serious questions:

-   Should politics simply be majoritarian or should minority interests be just as represented?
-   If politics shouldn&rsquo;t just be majoritarian, how do you effectively handle representation of minorities with as much weight as the majority?
