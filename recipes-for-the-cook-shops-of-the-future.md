# recipes for the cook-shops of the future

[[Marx]] was criticized by other socialists of his time for [[Capital Vol. 1]] because he failed to write &ldquo;recipes for the cook-shops of the future.&rdquo; By this, he meant that he didn&rsquo;t provide plans for how [[communism]] would work exactly.

Marx was generally hostile to ready-made utopias and criticized other contemporary socialists for doing so.
