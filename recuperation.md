# recuperation

Recuperation is the tendency for [[capital]] to reincorporate radical aesthetics back into itself.

Capital of late has been able to capitalize on and sell back any opposition to it.

Recuperation often turns aesthetics of resistance into [[signifiers]]. For example:

```text
Do you support Black Lives Matter? Put this sticker on your profile!
```


## Examples

[[Black Lives Matter]]
: [[recuperation of Black Lives Matter]]
