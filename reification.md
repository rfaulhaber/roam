# reification

Reification is the process by which an abstract thing (such as social relations) is treated as concrete. For example, &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; is a social problem, not a physical one.

It is not to be confused with [[fetishism]], which is when social relations are confused with something materially inherent.
