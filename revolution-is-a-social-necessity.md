# revolution is a social necessity

: [[revolution]]

In the same vein that [[revolution is unlikely to happen where the majority of people are comfortable]], revolution becomes as social necessity with the breakdown of society, rather than the systemic breakdown of capitalism. In both the [[French Revolution]] and [[1917 October Revolution]], each society was totally broken and non-functional, and so revolution became neccessary. The same is probably still true today.
