# right/left divide

: [[politics]]

The right/left divide is a perceived political divide in the modern era, between [[right wing]] and [[left wing]] politics. The divide comes from either the [[French Revolution]], where two factions formed in reaction to how the revolution should proceed, or from the legacy of [[Hegel]]&rsquo;s thought.

The divide could be seen as, essentially, one&rsquo;s attitude towards modern politics, with roughly &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; politics on the left and roughly &ldquo;regressive&rdquo; politics on the right. It could also be seen as your feeling towards [[contradiction]], with the left being seen as a force to embrace contradiction while the right seeks to eliminate it.
