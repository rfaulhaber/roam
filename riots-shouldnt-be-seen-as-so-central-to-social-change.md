# riots shouldn't be seen as so central to social change

[[Insurrectionary anarchists]] and [[communizers]] make too much of [[riots]].

Both would assert, I believe, that real revolutionary change is made during large-scale riots and uprisings.

However, I would argue that a riot is a [[crisis]] of sorts. The [[proletariat]] _could_ self-organize during a riot, however this would not be the time to do it or to create lasting institutions. The time to self-organize is in preparation for the crisis. That way resilient structures can be created to weather the crisis.

One might say that every [[revolution]] was an outgrowth of a riot, and that might be fair, but every revolution also featured structures that, going into the revolution, effected its outcome.
