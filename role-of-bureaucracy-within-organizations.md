Bureaucracy also comes with it process. The purpose of bureaucracy is often to stabalize an organization, and with that comes the fact that bureaucracy tends to neuter any kind of radical aspects of an organization. Bureaucrats often are people who come from outside an organization and have no &ldquo;skin in the game.&rdquo; Also, their role tends to separate the m from the rank and file of an organization.
