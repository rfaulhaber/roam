# science

I tend to think of science as the process and accumulation of knowledge of all things _material_. This is perhaps an imprecise definition.

What I do know about science at the time of writing this (07/04/2022) is this:

-   It is not a monolith. Capital-s &ldquo;Science&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t exist.
-   Areas of scientific inquiry are arbitrary. Why is chemistry distinct from physics?
-   Scientific knowledge is [[constructed]]. Scientific knowledge does not describe reality as it is, but seeks to model observed phenomena
-   The distinction between &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; sciences is arbitrary
-   &ldquo;soft&rdquo; sciences seek to model the world just as empirically as &ldquo;hard&rdquo; science. &ldquo;Soft&rdquo; science currently lacks an adequate framework for this, however. How can you make scientific statements about racism, which is systemic and structural?
