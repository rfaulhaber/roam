# singularity

tags
: [[artificial intelligence]]

The belief that technology will develop to such a point that machine intelligence will be on par with human intelligence. This idea was popularized in the late 90s.

The singularity idea fundamentally misunderstands how technology works, however, and is a concept of pure science fiction taken seriously. It assumes that [[technology is neutral]] and that [[technological progess is linear]]. It is a mystification of [[technological development]]. [[The singularity will not happen]].
