# socialism is more than just state power

There are certain strains of leftists, such as [[Marxist-Leninists]], who assert that [[socialism]] is nothing more than proletarian power over the state. Disregarding what &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; is, history has shown that communists can control the state and not move the state towards the abolition of [[value]]. Therefore, any transition away from [[capitalism]] must be more than just the seizure of state power by our team: it must move towards the abolition of capitalism, and not its fostering.
