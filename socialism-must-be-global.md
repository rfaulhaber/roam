# Socialism must be global

This is in opposition to the idea [[Stalin]] coined, (&ldquo;[[socialism in one country]]&rdquo;), which means that a country can move beyond [[capitalism]] within the framework of the [[nation state]].

The workers of the world have something in common: that they are workers, i.e. their relation to production is fundamentally different, and common throughout the capitalist world. The building of communism will be the responsibility of the entire world and cannot be limited to singular nations.
