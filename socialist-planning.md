There are a number of proposed solutions to socialist planning.

Socialist planning would be necessary as [[capitalism]] currently plans itself through the market. If our goal as communists is the abolition of class, money, and the state, we need to find a solution to this.

Some solutions are discussed here.


## Digital Socialism

This kind of planning refers to the use of computers to plan all social production. It is a commonly proposed solution, though a naive one.


## [[Gosplan]]

Gosplan refers to the [[central planning]] agency within the [[Soviet Union]].


## [[Cybersyn]]


## [[Market socialism]]
