# split between cybernetics and artificial intelligence

Around the late 1950s-early 1960s, [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cybernetics]] were the same field. Afterwards, they became distinct fields of study, with the former focusing on software and algorithms to do human-like computations, and the other primarily focusing on operations and systems research.
