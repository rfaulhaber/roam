# superego

Superego is part of the three-part model of [[consciousness]] as proposed by [[Sigmund Freud]] (the other parts being the [[id]] and the [[ego]]). The superego is the highest part of this hierarchy.

The superego is the thing that makes you second guess your own [[desire]]. [[Lacan]] believed, however, that the superego was integral to desire itself.

The superego can be thought of as the regulating authority between the id and the ego, however the superego&rsquo;s own existence comes from outside of the subject rather than from within it. Freud believes that a person&rsquo;s superego develops from either the regulating role of the father or from society more broadly.

The superego exists between people and therefore creates in- and out-groups. The law is one such example: cops violate the law and protect themselves doing so, and to expose this fact to the world outside of cops is to violate the superegoic connection. Therefore, as Todd McGowan says, the only person you can trust is a stranger rather than someone who is in your group.
