# Supply and demand being equal causes no value to be produced.

: [[capitalism]] [[supply and demand]]

Marx says in vol. 2 that if supply and demand were equal, the capitalist would not be able to valorize his capital. The capitalist is only able to &ldquo;sell dearer&rdquo; because he buys cheaper commodities and transforms them into more valuable ones. The capitalist aims to have a greater supply than demand because it allows him to valorize his capital at a greater rate.
