# Tcl

tags
: [[programming languages]]

Tcl is a programming language primarily used for scripting. Its website calls it &ldquo;the industry&rsquo;s best kept secret.&rdquo;

Tcl, unlike [[Bash]], is string-based, in the same sense that [[Lisp]] is list-based.

```tcl
set cmd "echo"
set arg "hello world"
exec $cmd $arg
```
