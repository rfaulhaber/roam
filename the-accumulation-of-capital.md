The accumulation of capital refers to the process by which wealth has a tendency to be concentrated by either individuals or firms.

The process of accumulating capital is relatively straightforward: through the production process, firms generate [[surplus-value]]. This surplus-value takes the form of money until the capitalist reinvests it back into the production process.

Capitalists are able to accumulate capital by means of [[wage labor]], where workers are paid for their [[labor-power]] rather than their labor.
