# the Constitution is designed to limit popular power

The Constitution was designed to limit popular power in the [[United States]]. The founders were absolutely terrified of popular power in any meaningful sense, and believed in a republic of _landowners_ first and foremost. Institutions like the [[Electoral College]] and the great difficulty to amend the Constitution show that the founders did not want anything resembling [[democracy]], or so-called &ldquo;mob rule.&rdquo;
