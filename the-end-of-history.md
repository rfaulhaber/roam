# the end of history

The end of history is an idea that comes either from [[Hegel]] or his later interpreters. Some would say that the end of history is the end to [[contradiction]], while others would say that it&rsquo;s merely the recognition that [[contradiction is eternal]].

For [[Marxism]], the end of history is usually synonymous with [[communism]], which could be seen as an end to political contradiction. Personally, I&rsquo;m not sure that I agree with this, as I think [[politics]] will continue after [[capitalism]], but will merely take on a different form, such as debates over what society should collectively produce.
