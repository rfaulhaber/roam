# the Jakarta method

The Jakarta method was the [[anti-communist]] playbook used by the [[CIA]] to crush anything that threatened global [[capitalism]] during the [[Cold War]]. The term is in reference to the [[Indonesian]] capital of Jakarta.

The strategy amounted to committing incredible acts of violence on communists, or anyone who would be vaguely opposed to capitalist hegemony.
