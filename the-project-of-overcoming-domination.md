# the project of overcoming domination

[[Cordelia]] emphasizes the role of [[impersonal domination]] in [[capitalism]]. Having listened to a lot of what she has to say, I&rsquo;m inclined to think that the ultimate political project one should strive for is the end of [[domination]] entirely. This is no short order!

Ultimately, for the first time in human history we have the ability to make the world as we see fit. This involves removing the existing order and building a world free from the injustices and mistakes of the past. I don&rsquo;t aspire for [[utopia]], but I know that I aspire for a world that is _not_ this one.

This, I think, is maybe the best way to articulate the problem. The problem isn&rsquo;t hierarchy, authority, or even just power itself. We will not have [[freedom]] until we destroy domination, and to me that sounds more realistic than anything else, since, the great contribution of [[Karl Marx]] was that he was able to show that domination is fundamentally [[material]].

To me, this is [[communism]], and why I call myself a communist instead of anything else.
