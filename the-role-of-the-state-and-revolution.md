# the role of the state and revolution

The precondition for this discussion is a belief in the necessity for a [[transition period]] and a [[transition to communism]].

[[Marx]] believed that the [[state]] could not be used to achieve the aims of [[communism]] during a [[revolution]], as the [[character of the state was for protecting the class interests of the bourgeoisie]].

[[Lenin]], in his book _The State and Revolution_, elaborated on [[Marx]]&rsquo;s ideas on the state, believing that the working class ought to smash the state and establish one that could being the [[transition to communism]]. Lenin believed in a [[lower phase of communism]] and a [[higher phase of communism]], and felt that the role of the state varied between those two phases. He then believed that by the time the latter came around, the [[state would wither away]].
