# there is no alternative

: [[capitalism]] [[communism]]

[[Margret Thatcher]] famously said that &ldquo;there is no alternative&rdquo; to capitalism, and this quote has come to encapsulate the way many people today think about alternatives to capitalism and the future. Many depictions of the future in sci-fi and elsewhere since the 80s simply display an [[eternal present]] rather than a positive vision of the future.

It has also been said that &ldquo;it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is the end of capitalism.&rdquo;
