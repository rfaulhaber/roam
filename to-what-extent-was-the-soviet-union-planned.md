# to what extent was the Soviet Union planned?

Nominally the [[Soviet Union]] was a [[planned economy]], however it&rsquo;s not clear to me to what extent that was true. The [[Bolsheviks]] didn&rsquo;t initially plan for a planned economy. [[Gosplan]] was eventually developed but it may not have driven the economy.

Hillel Ticktin says that the Soviet Union was a [[non-mode of production]].
