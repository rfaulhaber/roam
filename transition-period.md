# transition period

This refers specifically to program details in the [[transition to communism]]. See the previous link for philosophical details.


## Goals of a transition period

-   Enshrining of worker&rsquo;s right to organize and self-organize. Workers should be able to control all facets of their lives, and the state (such as it would exist) and the productive organizations would need to support that. The goal should be the self-organization of the working class.
-   Ensuring the survival of humanity through [[climate change]].
-   Preventing mass death
-   The [[abolition of money]]
