# use of irony is a means of coping with trauma

I don&rsquo;t have a source for this claim but soldiers in the [[First World War]] frequently used irony as a means of coping with the fact that they all felt that they were going to die.

Is the usage of irony in online spaces now a sign of a deeply traumatized society?
