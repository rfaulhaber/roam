# virtual machine

A virtual machine is a program that emulates a computer.

There are two kinds of virtual machines, broadly speaking:

-   Language virtual machines, such as the [[Java]] virtual machine ([[JVM]]). These are usually with the explicit purpose of running and executing language bytecode
-   System virtual machines, which can emulate running operating systems. [[QEMU]] is one such example
