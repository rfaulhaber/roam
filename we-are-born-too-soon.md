# we are born too soon

[[Freud]] has this notion that humans are born too soon. Unlike, say, deer or cats or birds, humans are born not knowing how to do anything and thus must figure it out on their own. This in turn allows room for things like consciousness as a process of self-discovery. Animals do not have to discover themselves or their purpose, but we do.
