# what does a world without alienation look like?

If we go strictly by [[Marx&rsquo;s view]], a world without [[alienation]] might look like one where a person:

-   has control over their own labor and the product of their own labor
-   is not isolated, belongs to a community
-   can use their creative powers as they see fit
-   _feels_ that they belong to a community, and that they owe it to their community to work
    -   think: in the same way pre-industrial societies did
