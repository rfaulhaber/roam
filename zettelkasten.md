# zettelkasten

The Zettelkasten method is a method for note-taking and resource management. It is what I&rsquo;m trying to do with all these org-roam files, but I feel like I&rsquo;m failing!

Notes in Zettelkasten should be:

atomic
: notes should pertain to one specific topic

connected
: there should be clear lines between related notes

I need to start using org-roam more for personal notes as well as knowledge notes.

## Ways to improve use of Zettelkasten with Roam

-   Capture fleeting notes (optional)
-   Connect literature notes (notes on books, articles, etc.) with ideas and reflections
-   Create reflection, &ldquo;argument&rdquo;, notes. Use the connection between notes to generate new ideas (see &ldquo;permanent notes&rdquo;)
-   Note to self: you&rsquo;re already doing this! Notes like &ldquo;Marx&rdquo; etc. are permanent notes! You just need to be willing to actually fill them out and notice when they interest you! :)
